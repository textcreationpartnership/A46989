            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Judicious Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ≈øoon as His Maje≈øty had been plea≈øed to lay His Commands upon me, to Collect materials for this Subject; I could not but reflect that it was to Treat of a matter that I knew not any had Writ upon before; and of ≈øuch a largene≈øs, that it takes in not only the Ca≈øe of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College but regards all other Corporations and Societies of that Con≈øtitution, and ≈øpreads it ≈øelf into ≈øome branches of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal: Wherefore the nature of the Thing requires a Treati≈øe of me, not altogether un≈øuitable to the Dignity of the per≈øons concerned, <hi>viz.</hi> The King and the Univer≈øities, which would induce per≈øons of all Ranks to peru≈øe it, who de≈øire ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in a matter of ≈øuch importance both to the Prince and Subject.</p>
            <p>This ≈øugge≈øted to me a nece≈ø≈øity of enquiring into Records of preceding ages, and to render the Work, at lea≈øt, a Collection of various in≈øtances in ≈øeveral Ca≈øes of Vi≈øitations.</p>
            <p>Therefore finding no compleat Hi≈øtory of any Vi≈øitation of our Univer≈øities, except that of the long Parliament, I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it nece≈ø≈øary to give an Impartial account of the proceedings, from the Kings Mandate for Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> to the clo≈øe of the Vi≈øitations by the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners; whereby, this and after
<pb facs="tcp:66217:3"/>ages might have an Authentic Precedent, if any occa≈øion ≈øhould happen of this kind, and that people concerned might know their Boundaries; and in this part I followed the Regi≈øters, Original Papers, Authentic Copies of Letters and Orders, or the Diaries &amp; accounts of ≈øuch as were pre≈øent, and actors in the di≈øqui≈øition; and in this particular I have u≈øed as much diligence as I could, not to be impo≈øed upon, and had fini≈øhed mo≈øt of this before the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Relation was Printed; and wherein I differ from that, I have done it upon the be≈øt Intelligence I could obtain.</p>
            <p>After the fini≈øhing of this I judged it not improper, before I entred upon An≈øwering the Objections I found urged by the Vice-Pre≈øident and Fellows of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, to clear the Kings Prerogative over the Univer≈øities, in making, and Abrogating their Statutes, or di≈øpen≈øing with them, and placing or di≈ø placing of their Members, which obliged me to con≈øider the matter not only in General, but al≈øo to de≈øcend to many particulars, and ≈øhew, who by the Kings Authority or ≈øufferance have exerci≈øed the like Authority; In which I have endeavored to follow the mo≈øt approved Authors, and ≈øure≈øt Records.</p>
            <p>I have the rather enlarged upon this head, that I might afford variety of Ca≈øes, whereby the di≈øtinct claims of Right of Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation might be Illu≈øtrated, and this Tract might be a Repertory, whereby, upon emergences, the Original Records might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</p>
            <p>If ≈øome may judge me too tedious, I de≈øire them to con≈øider, that it was not enough to clear the point of St. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> College, but likewi≈øe to di≈øcover in what other Ca≈øes the
<pb facs="tcp:66217:3"/>Kings of <hi>England</hi> had exerted their Prerogatives.</p>
            <p>The Contemplation of this led me to touch, tho' with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand, the <hi>Regalia</hi> of our Kings, and look into the Laws and u≈øages of former times, and in what ≈øort the Soveraignty and Supremacy of our Kings in matters of Eccle≈øia≈øtical cogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are declared by the Laws in being. In which part I treat of the Kings Authority ab≈øtractedly from Doctrinal Religion.</p>
            <p>This I the rather have done, that the Subjects of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may ob≈øerve how great the Authority and Prerogative of the King is, in di≈øpen≈øing with Univer≈øity and College Statutes, ≈øince by the plain and direct Laws that A≈ø≈øert the Kings Right, in oppo≈øition to all Foreign powers, his Supremacy is ≈øo E≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Eccle≈øia≈øtical matters and cau≈øes, that it is applicable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpo≈øes than at the fir≈øt view may appear obvious, which I leave to the di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe better ver≈øed in the Laws than I ≈øhall ever pre≈øume to be. Neverthele≈øs I hope in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ≈øubject, it will be owned, that I have Introduced no Novelty, but Copy'd what is found in Hi≈øtory or the public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and brought to light a Prerogative in≈øeparable from the Royal State of our Kings, which ≈øome for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulting the ≈øame have not ≈øo well di≈øcerned.</p>
            <p>It is to caution the Heads and Fellows of our mo≈øt eminent Univer≈øities not to contend with their Sovereign, that I have ≈øo copiou≈øly produced In≈øtances of the practice of former times, and have ≈øo largely treated of them before and ≈øince the Reformation.</p>
            <p>It was for this end ≈øolely, and not in the lea≈øt to erect Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies for any Victory over the unfortunate, that I have pointed out the≈øe Sea-marks, that others may avoid da≈øhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb facs="tcp:66217:4"/>again≈øt the Rock, upon which the Briti≈øh Monarchy is ≈øo firmly placed, that no Tempe≈øts of open Rebellion, or the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ≈øwelling Seas, much le≈øs any ≈øingle Billow can be able to ≈øhake.</p>
            <p>It is far from my Intention in this, to enter into any di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the limits of Eccle≈øia≈øtical or Secular power: It is ≈øufficient that I ≈øhew it in ≈øome particulars of known practice; without examining the grounds, any more than as declared by the po≈øitive Laws or practice of the re≈øpective Sovereigns.</p>
            <p>I know ≈øome may look upon this as a matter treated of <hi>ex ≈øuperabundanti,</hi> yet I thought my ≈øelf obliged ≈øo far to enter into a di≈ø≈øertation upon it, as I might thereby make it appear, that by the exten≈øivene≈øs of the Sovereignty, Univer≈øities, much more private Colleges, (both which the Law accounts among the Creatures of the Crown) mu≈øt own a ≈øubjection of them≈øelves and their private Statutes, to the King as Supreme.</p>
            <p>Neither hath it been any de≈øire to render the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive greater than the Laws and u≈øages of our Kings do manife≈øt that I have ≈øhewn how it hath been in≈øi≈øted upon, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt ≈øome exemptions of the Apo≈øtolic See, or to E≈øtabli≈øh any Paradox; but only to A≈ø≈øert the ju≈øt Rights of the Crown, at lea≈øt according to my Reading, and do with all deference ≈øubmit what I have compo≈øed, to the Judgment of the Learned in our Laws.</p>
            <p>But to leave this; I de≈øire the Candid Reader will peru≈øe the Contents of the Book in the following Pages, before he enter upon the whole, whereby he may ≈øee the connexion, and ≈øequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:66217:4"/>of the matter; and he mu≈øt not expect that tho≈øe Contents are exactly according to the Marginal Notes, but according to the matter treated in the ≈øeveral Paragraphs, and Pages; in ≈øome of which he will find ≈øome rectifyings of what by chance was mi≈ø-printed.</p>
            <p>I mu≈øt likewi≈øe here give ≈øatisfaction to the Reader why I have added an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the whole, and thereby plead my excu≈øe, why this Treati≈øe hath been ≈øo long Printed, in the greate≈øt part, before it was Publi≈øhed: The Rea≈øons of which are the≈øe in ≈øhort.</p>
            <p>Being de≈øirous to obtain an exact account from the Regi≈øters of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, concerning Dr. <hi>Haddons</hi> being Elected upon King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6ths. Mandate, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ca≈øe was exactly Parallel to this in hand; I made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the late Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Vice-Pre≈øident, but the Sickne≈øs and Death of the fir≈øt, and the taking away of ≈øome Keys where the Regi≈øters were pre≈øerved, hindred me from recieving ≈øatisfaction from the one or other: So that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ≈øtop the Printing, I was forced to pa≈øs by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, with a Reference to treat of it after; and when by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying my ≈øelf to the Learned Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> Author of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of that Univer≈øity, I could get no other ≈øatisfaction, than appears by his Letter I have Printed: I begun to de≈øpair of retriving it, and ≈øo re≈øolved to have clo≈øed all without it: Yet being very unwilling to neglect any thing I could do in a matter of ≈øuch Importance, I applyed my ≈øelf to the Right Reverend Bi≈øhop <hi>Giffard,</hi> from whom, after his Lord≈øhips arrival I had ≈ømall encouragement; but at la≈øt after repeated ≈øollicitations,
<pb facs="tcp:66217:5"/>by his Lord≈øhips directions, and the indu≈øtry of a Learned Gentleman, and Conference with Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> the Regi≈øter was found, but ≈øo late as the matter could not otherwi≈øe be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted but in an <hi>Appendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble the Courteous Reader with the di≈øtinct Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, why other matters are there likewi≈øe in≈øerted; but only in general, that ≈øome of them being committed to ≈øome hands that had mi≈ø-layed them, or taken them with them upon ≈øome remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals from Town, I could not retrive them when the matters were Printing which they related to; and ≈øome few of them have come to my knowledge ≈øince Writing of the re≈øt: ≈øo that the Candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mu≈øt be de≈øired to place them according to the Notes in the Margents directing for that purpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, I mu≈øt de≈øire the Reader will not peru≈øe this by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or come to the Reading of it with prejudice, a≈ø≈øuring him the Author is free from pa≈ø≈øion and private de≈øign and hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to adhere to the Laws, for which purpo≈øe he hath ≈øhewn the whole to ≈øome of the eminente≈øt in that Profe≈ø≈øion, and hath had Approbation accordingly.</p>

                     <p>I Have In≈øerted this Mandate at length as I ≈øhall the re≈øt of the Letters and Di≈øpatches, becau≈øe there being nothing that I know of Printed of a Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereby the curious may be ≈øatisfied in the very Forms of Addre≈øs and Proceedings; I thought
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66217:19"/>it might be grateful to ≈øuch, and might be In≈øtructive to after times and tho≈øe who have not acce≈øs to the Secretaries or Paper Office: and I have kept my ≈øelf as much as I could, to the Originals and Regi≈øters, that as to matters of Fact none might have occa≈øion to find fault with me for giving a partial account, neither have I omitted the ≈øtre≈øs of the Pleadings by Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> or the Vice-Pre≈øident or Fellows; and tho' I have not Interrupted the Series of the Di≈øcour≈øe by an≈øwering the Arguments as they were In≈øi≈øted upon; yet I have in the clo≈øe of the Di≈øcour≈øe ≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up all that they could or did ≈øay by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and given ≈øuch An≈øwers to them as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter required, and ≈øhall take notice of the late Treati≈øe, called <hi>A Relation of the Proceedings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Containing only matters of Fact,</hi> publi≈øhed on purpo≈øe to make the generality of the people favor the Ejected. Whereas I hope to make it appear, that the King might have proceeded in a ≈øummary way, and if he had plea≈øed inflicted ≈øeverer puni≈øhments upon them than the Commi≈ø≈øioners have done, and tho' at ≈øome times there ≈øeems to be a dutiful behavior in the Fellows, and expre≈ø≈øions that were agreeable to the condition of humble Subjects, and a plea of tenderne≈øs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience in not daring to break their Oaths, yet in effect whenever they were put upon a pinch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would yield to the King's Authority, and acknowledge them≈øelves to have acted contrary to their Duties, they never would own they had been in the wrong, which was the true cau≈øe why tho≈øe that refu≈øed to ≈øub≈øcribe the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion that was at la≈øt propo≈øed to them were ≈øo Expelled, and however ≈øome might at fir≈øt Interpo≈øe for them, as the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> did in the following Letter; yet in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66217:20"/>progre≈øs of this Di≈øcour≈øe I ≈øhall make it clear, that in former times greater puni≈øhments than that of Expul≈øion, even to Impri≈øonments, have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon ≈øuch as have ≈øhewed le≈øs ob≈øtinacy and contempt of the Authority of their Sovereign.</p>

This Method and procedure being mo≈øt prudent, and dutiful, and fit to be entered upon immediatly. The King having interpo≈øed his Royal plea≈øure and Authority; which if it had not been done, I readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we not only might but ought to proceed to the Election of a Pre≈øident in that very In≈øtant, according to the expre≈øs Letter of the Statute in every particular. But for this, let every one concerned be his own Ca≈øui≈øt. The≈øe are my private Thoughts, and upon mature deliberation: I conceive that I ≈øhould be very defective in my Duty to the King, and my Re≈øpect to you (whatever Mi≈ø-interpretation ≈øome po≈ø≈øibly may frame of it.) If I had not made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them at this meeting.</p>

                     <p>‚òû It hath been the practice in former times, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canon Laws, that when any Superior enjoyned any matter upon Inferiors which they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be prejudicial to their Rights: It was their Duty <hi>re≈øcribere,</hi> to Write to the Prince, or other Superior to ≈øhew him wherein, by ≈øuch Mandate their Rights were invaded, or what other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences might en≈øue, and not to proceed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to do that which was forbid; e≈øpecially not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Election as here they did when the King had after their Petition pre≈øented to him, expre≈ø≈øed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, that he would be obeyed.

                     <p>‚òû By this it appears how ≈øedulous the new Elected Pre≈øident and the Fellows were, to have the Election confirmed; pre≈øuming, that this being done, the Pre≈øident would have a Legal Right, and could not be removed but by cour≈øe of Common Law: But I hope to ≈øhew hereafter, that the practice of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Vi≈øitors appointed either by the Kings or the Popes (the latter of who≈øe power our pre≈øent Laws give his Maje≈øty) hath been to di≈øpen≈øe with Statutes, and to place, and di≈øplace for di≈øobedience, Heads of Colleges and Fellows by the ≈øignificaton of their Royal plea≈øure, or to Impower Vi≈øitors by Commi≈ø≈øion to do the ≈øame; and of this it cannot be conceived, that the Members of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege could be Ignorant; but that they rather were animated to lay hold of this opportunity, to ≈øee if they could di≈øpute the Kings Authority, or which is of equal concern to many, render the King's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons di≈øobliging, whereby they might gain the point of rai≈øing iealou≈øie, and male-contentedne≈øs in peoples minds, with which de≈øigns I will not charge all the Members of the Society; But it is too apparent, that tho≈øe who underhand encourged them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt in their oppo≈øition, de≈øigned ≈øome ≈øuch matter.</p>

And being confined as to the time of our Election, we have been forced to proceed to the Choice of one who has approved his Loyalty in the whole cour≈øe of his Life, and whom we think Statutably qualified for the place.</p>
                                 <p>May it therefore plea≈øe your Grace to Interpo≈øe with his Mo≈øt Sacred Maje≈øty in our behalfs, that we may not lie under the weight of his di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure for not being in a capacity of obeying his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

                     <p>UPon the fir≈øt Notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Clark,</hi> Late Pre≈øident of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Vice-Pre≈øident called a Meeting of the Fellows, in order to appoint a day for Election of a new Pre≈øident.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66217:26"/>as they ≈øhould ≈øee cau≈øe till the <hi>15th.</hi> beyond which time it was not in their Power to defer the ≈øame.

                     <p>As to their former practice, when they have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in obedience to the Kings Letters heretofore, it has been always in ≈øuch Ca≈øes where the per≈øons recommended have been every way qualified for this Office by their Statutes, in which ca≈øes they always have been and ever will be ready to comply with His Maje≈øties plea≈øure, it not being without un≈øpeakable regret that they di≈øobey the lea≈øt of His Commands.

                                 <p>That upon notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Clark,</hi> late Pre≈øident of the ≈øaid College, the Vice-Pre≈øident called a Meeting of the ≈øaid Fellows in order to appoint a day for Election of a new Pre≈øident and the <hi>13th.</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> la≈øt, was the time prefixt, with power to prorogue the ≈øame as they ≈øhould ≈øee cau≈øe until the <hi>15th.</hi> day of the ≈øame Month, beyond which time they could not Statutably defer their Election, and in pur≈øuance thereof a Citation or Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition was fixed upon the Chappel-door of the ≈øaid College, ≈øignifying the ≈øame, and by which the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Fellows are ≈øummoned to repair home to the ≈øaid Election, as the Statute in that ca≈øe requires.</p>
                                 <p>And the ≈øaid Vice-Pre≈øident and other deputed Fellows further ≈øay, that upon the <hi>11th.</hi> day of the ≈øaid Month of <hi>April</hi> they received His Maje≈øties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters requiring them to Elect and Admit the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> to be Pre≈øident of the ≈øaid College. But fora≈ømuch as the ≈øaid Vice-Pre≈øident and the other Fellows apprehended the Right of Election to be in them≈øelves, and did believe His Maje≈øty never intended to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them of their Rights; And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈ømuch as the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> had never been Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, or of <hi>New</hi>-College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and had not tho≈øe qualifications which in and by the Statutes of the ≈øaid College are required in the Character of a Pre≈øident, as they in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences did and do verily believe, and in regard they

They repre≈øented the ≈øame by their Humble Petition to His Maje≈øty, and having deferred their Election of a Pre≈øident to the la≈øt day limited by their Statutes, they then proceeded to Election. And having fir≈øt Received the Ble≈ø≈øed Euchari≈øt, and taken the ≈øaid Oaths, as the Statutes require, to choo≈øe a per≈øon ≈øo qualified as is before expre≈øt, they did Elect the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Hough</hi> Batchellor in Divinity, and one of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the ≈øaid College, a per≈øon every way quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be their Pre≈øident, who has been ≈øince Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Lord Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> their Vi≈øitor, as the Statutes of the ≈øaid College direct.</p>
                                 <p>And that they might not lie under His Maje≈øties di≈øplea≈øure by their proceedings, on the <hi>19th.</hi> day of the ≈øaid Month of <hi>April</hi> they made humble Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentation thereof to His Maje≈øty, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Chancellor of the Univer≈øity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ≈øetting forth their indi≈øpen≈øable obligation to ob≈øerve their Founders Statutes.</p>
                                 <p>All which matters the ≈øaid Vice-Pre≈øident, and other deputed Fellows, do humbly offer to your Lord≈øhips con≈øideration, and pray to be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed with your Lord≈øhips favor.</p>

                     <p>Since therefore they were not required to <hi>Elect</hi> him, but only <hi>Admit</hi> him by vertue of the Kings Mandate, the King having by that ≈øuper≈øeded the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66217:44"/>former for Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> no Man can think it ≈øtrange, that the King re≈øolved to Cha≈øti≈øe them for their contempt in a method Ju≈øtifiable by Canon, Civil and Statute Law, both to vindicate his own Royal Authority, as likewi≈øe to deter others from following ≈øuch pernicious Examples.</p>

                                    <p>IF he who provokes the King to Anger ≈øins again≈øt his own Soul, what a Complicated mi≈øchief is yours, who have done and repeated it in ≈øuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and Indecent manner as you have done, and upon ≈øuch a trifling occa≈øion? You were the fir≈øt, and I hope will be the la≈øt, who did ever thus unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervedly provoke him. There is a great Re≈øpect and Reverence due to the Per≈øons of Kings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the Contempt of his Authority in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, you were ≈øo unrea≈øonably Valiant as to have none of tho≈øe fears and jealou≈øies about you, which ought to po≈ø≈øe≈øs all Subjects in their Princes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, with a due veneration of his Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. 'Tis neither good nor ≈øafe for any ≈øort of Men to be wi≈øer than their Governors; nor to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Lawful Commands of their Superiors, in ≈øuch a licentious manner, that if they ≈øometimes obey for wrath, they oftner di≈øobey, (as they pretend,) for Con≈øcience ≈øake. The King is God's Mini≈øter, he receives his Authority from him, and Governs for him here below; and God re≈øents all Indignities and injuries done to him, as done to him≈øelf. Now God hath ≈øet a Ju≈øt and Gracious King over us, who has obliged us in ≈øuch a Princely manner, as to puzle our Under≈øtandings as well as our Gratitude; for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66217:46"/>he hath bound him≈øelf by his Sacred promi≈øe to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Altars, at which he does not Wor≈øhip; and in the fir≈øt place to maintain our Bi≈øhops and Arch-Bi≈øhops, and all the Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in their Rights Privileges and Endowments.</p>
                                    <p>No doubt but he will do his own Religion all the Right and Service he can, without unju≈øt and cruel Methods, which he utterly abhors; and without wronging ours, which is by Law E≈øtabli≈øhed; and by his own Sacred and free promi≈øes, which have been more than once renewed, and repeated to us, without our ≈øeeking or ≈øolliciting for them, which we, under ≈øome Princes, might have been put to crave upon our bended Knees. This is a mo≈øt Royal and Voluntary Pre≈øent the King hath made to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and calls for a ≈øuitable veneration from them; notwith≈øtanding the pretended <hi>Oxford</hi> Rea≈øons, which were Publi≈øh'd (by who≈øe means and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors you be≈øt know,) to ob≈øtruct it: As if the King had not Thorns enough growing in his Kingdom, without his Univer≈øities planting more. Now a Prince ≈øo exceedingly tender of his Honor as he is, ≈øo highly Ju≈øt to all, and ≈øo kind beyond example to his Loyal Subjects and Servants of what per≈øua≈øion ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is one under whom you might have had all the ea≈øe, ≈øatisfaction, and ≈øecurity imaginable, if you had not been notoriou≈øly wanting to your ≈øelves, and under a vain pretence of acting for the pre≈øervation of our Religion, you had not wilfully, again≈øt all Rea≈øon and Religion, expos'd it, (as much as in you lay,) to the greate≈øt ≈øcandal and apparent dangers Imaginable. Your di≈øingenuous, di≈øobliging, and petulant humor, your ob≈øtinate and unrea≈øonable ≈øtifne≈øs, hath brought this pre≈øent Vi≈øitation upon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66217:46"/>you; and might ju≈øtly have provoked His Maje≈øty to have done tho≈øe things in his di≈øplea≈øure, which might have been more prejudicial to this, and other Societies, then you can ea≈øily imagin.</p>
                                    <p>But tho' you have been very irregular in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, yet the King is re≈øolved to be exactly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in his proceedings; And accordingly, as he is Supreme Ordinary of this Kingdom, which is his Inherent Right, of which he never can be dive≈øted, and the unque≈øtionable Vi≈øitor of all Colleges; he hath delegated his Commi≈ø≈øioners with full Power to proceed according to the ju≈øt mea≈øures of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øtical Laws, and his Royal Prerogative again≈øt ≈øuch offenders as ≈øhall be found among≈øt you, and not otherwi≈øe.</p>
                                    <p>'Tis a great grief to all ≈øober Men to ≈øee any, who would be thought True Sons of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> act like Men frighted out of their wits, and Religion, as you have certainly done.</p>
                                    <p>Never any True Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was, or will be di≈øobedient to his Prince; the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty which ≈øhe hath taught us, is ab≈øolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional. Tho' our Prince ≈øhould not plea≈øe, or humor us, we are neither to open our Mouths, or lift up our hands again≈øt him.</p>
                                    <p>Yours, like all other Corporations, is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Crown; and how then dur≈øt you make your Statutes ≈øpurn again≈øt their Maker? Is this your way to recommend and adorn our Religion, and not rather to make it odious; by practi≈øing that in ≈øuch a froward manner which our Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øes to abhor? Do we not pray for the King, as the Head of it under Chri≈øt? Do we not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for the Fountain of Honor? And does not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66217:47"/>
                                       <hi>Solomon</hi> Command his Sons to fear God and the King, the one with a Religious, the other with a Civil fear? Is he not the Lord's Annointed, and not to be toucht but with Reverence, either in his Crown or Per≈øon? And why ≈øhould we not render then to all their dues, Fear to whom Fear, and Honor to whom Honor? Is not this an Eternal tye both of Ju≈øtice and Gratitude? For where the Word of a King is, there is Power; And who may ≈øay unto him, what do≈øt Thou? Are we not, next to God, and his Good Angels, mo≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him for our ≈øafety, who≈øe Honor and Lawful Authority We are now come to Vindicate? Is he not the Father of our Country, and ought he not to be more dear to Us than our Natural Parents; e≈øpecially con≈øidering how Indulgent he has been to Us, and what care he dayly takes to keep us from biting and devouring one another, we know not why. Is not he the Center of the Kingdom, and do not the concurrence of all Lines meet in him, and his fortunes; and how can we then under≈øtand the limits of ≈øelf love, if a tender Sen≈øe of his Honor and happine≈øs be not deeply rooted and imprinted in our Souls? 'Twas neither dutifully nor wi≈øely done of you, to drive the King to a nece≈ø≈øity of bringing this Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon you. And as it mu≈øt needs grieve every Loyal and Religious Man in the Kingdom to the heart, to find Men of your Liberal Education and Parts ≈øo Untractable, and Refractory to ≈øo Gracious a Prince; ≈øo it will be very mi≈øchievous to you, at the Great Day of Gods Vi≈øitation; Who will then be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt loo≈øers by your Contumacy: For God will Revenge this among your other Crimes, that you have behav'd your ≈øelves ≈øo ungratefully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Vicegerent, as to oppre≈øs his Royal Heart
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66217:47"/>with grief for your Stubbornne≈øs, to whom by your chearful Obedience, you ought to have admini≈øtred much cau≈øe of rejoycing. They who Sow the Seeds of Di≈øobedience, have never any great rea≈øon to boa≈øt of their Harve≈øt, for what≈øoever they vainly promi≈øe them≈øelves in the beginning, they are in the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamed, and afraid of the Income of their evil Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and indeed every ≈øort of di≈øobedience hath ≈øo ill a report in the World, that even they who are guilty of it them≈øelves, do yet ≈øpeak ill of it in others: Let therefore the di≈øreputation, and Obloquy which it will inevitably bring upon you, make you out of Love with it; or if that will not do, let the Stings of your guilty Con≈øciences, and the fear of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance re≈øtrain you; or if you are ≈øtill In≈øen≈øible of all the≈øe, yet at lea≈øt let the pre≈øent fear of tho≈øe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puni≈øhments, which the Laws of the Kingdom have ≈øuperadded to the Contemners of Gods and the Kings Authority, oblige every Soul that hears me this day to be Subject to the Higher Powers. If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a mo≈øt Merciful God, nor a mo≈øt Gracious King can plea≈øe you, your wages will he recompence upon your own Heads: Were it not for this Serpent of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and jealou≈øies, which are now ≈øo bu≈øie in it, this Kingdom would be like the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> before the Cur≈øe, a Mirrour of pro≈øperity and happine≈øs to all the World be≈øides, but this Serpentine humor of Stinging and Biting one another, and of Tempting Men to Rebel again≈øt God and the King, becau≈øe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who differ from us in Judgment are as happy as our ≈øelves, will as certainly turn us, as it did our fir≈øt Parents, out of Paradi≈øe. Our Nation is in greater danger of being de≈øtroyed by Prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, then Popery; by Sin, then by Super≈øtition; by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66217:48"/>other Iniquities, then by Idolatry; and I pray God we may not ≈øee Sacrilege once more committed under the pretence of abhorring Idols, as I my ≈øelf have ≈øeen in this place. If there be any among you who have ≈øinn'd with ≈øo high a hand again≈øt our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, as the obdurate Jews did again≈øt our Saviour, ≈øaying, we will not have this Man to Rule over us; ≈øuch your petulant humor, ≈øuch your ≈øhameful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtice and Ingratitude, will de≈øerve the ju≈øt Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øions of this Court. What di≈øtempers this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is ≈øick of, which we are now come to vi≈øit by the Kings Commi≈ø≈øion, your ≈øelves are be≈øt able to tell us: We are informed of too many already, and yet we ≈øu≈øpect there may be more; and therefore be but Ingenuous, and make a Con≈øcience of giving us ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere An≈øwers, and you ≈øhall find, that we will abate nothing of the ju≈øt mea≈øures of our Duty for fear or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, to ≈øatisfie the Importunities of any Man; being well a≈ø≈øured that God and the King will bear us out. I am ≈øorry that you ≈øhould any of you run ≈øo far upon the ≈øcore of the Kings Royal Patience and Pardon, as ≈øome of you have already done; And that you ≈øhould be in ≈øuch va≈øt Arrears of Duty and Re≈øpect to him as you are. But they go far who never turn: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence you may have upon other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, makes me Charitably hope, that your future Fidelity, and Allegiance will for ever An≈øwer your Duty, and the Kings ju≈øt Expectation; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope it will not be in vain for me to exhort you in the Bowels of Chri≈øt to a more entire ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and obedience; becau≈øe if ≈øuch Men as you, bred in ≈øo Famous an Univer≈øity, are not thoroughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the nece≈ø≈øity of it; the more Popular you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the more pernicious will you be in encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66217:48"/>your deluded Admirers, who have their Eyes upon you from all parts of the Kingdom, to be as Di≈øobedient and Contumacious as your ≈øelves: by which the Honor and Authority of the King may be dimini≈øhed, and the peace both of Church and State come to be endanger'd. Obey them who have the Rule over you, either in Church or State, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ≈øelves before it be too late; for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious behaviour towards them will yeild you no profit at all; but your Obedience much every way; the former will prove like the Sin of Witch-craft, but the latter will be better accepted than Sacrifice, becau≈øe in that you only offer up a bea≈øt to God, but in this you Sacrifice your Pa≈ø≈øions, you ≈ølay them and offer them up to Gods ≈øervice. Remember Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ≈øeldom goes in Company with Obedience, and that none are ≈øo likely to find the way to Eternal happine≈øs in the end, as they who follow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Superiors from the beginning; not with Eye ≈øervice, as Men plea≈øers; but in ≈øinglene≈øs of Heart, Fearing God and the King; and what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do, do it heartily; as unto the Lord, and not unto us Men: And the Lord give you under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> gave in the following Paper at the ≈øame time.</p>
                     <p>AS to your Lord≈øhips Que≈øtion propo≈øed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have applyed the Revenue of any Land, or other E≈øtate, given for Ho≈øpitality, to private u≈øes, we cannot for want of time give your Lord≈øhips that ≈øatisfaction, and full Accompt which we de≈øire, and ≈øhall do hereafter when we ≈øhall look over the Evidences and the E≈øtate of the College, of which we are but the U≈øu-fructuaries, and other Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uments locked up in the Tower.</p>
                     <p>As to our Ho≈øpitality in General, the Bur≈øers Table is the place where not only our Tenants, but Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, according to their Quality are Entertained, there being a dayly Allowance made by the College for that purpo≈øe, which when ≈øcanty, and not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a ≈øuitable Entertainment, it is left in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ca≈øes to the di≈øcretion of the Bur≈øers to add what they ≈øhall Judge fit and becoming. But be≈øides this it is our con≈øtant Practice and Cu≈øtom at the end of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66217:64"/>the Year to give Sums of Mony away to the poor, which are greater, or le≈øs, according to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plu≈øage of our Corn Rents that year.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Bur≈øers are Impowered to give Mony away to the poor, upon the greater and more ≈øolemn Fe≈øtivals of the year. Fourthly, Oftentimes upon great Emergencies, ≈øuch as were the Brief for the Re-edifying the Town of <hi>Northampton,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building the Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> for the relief of the French Prote≈øtants, be≈øides other Briefs for Fires and for Redemption of Captives, and the like, we give con≈øiderable Sums of Mony, as well out of the public Stock, as out of our private Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes.</p>
                     <p>As for turning the remaining part of the Ho≈øpital of St. <hi>John,</hi> about twenty Years ≈øince, into Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chambers, which were very much wanting for the Fellows, that alteration was not made without con≈øulting the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winton</hi> our Local Vi≈øitor, and without having obtained his Lord≈øhips con≈øent. There having been no u≈øe as we could ever learn from our Predece≈ø≈øors of tho≈øe Rooms, and as we may ≈øeem, not without good grounds, to believe, ≈øince the Time that Pilgrimages were left off, and di≈ø-u≈øed here in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my Lords, if upon re-≈øearch (which we will endeavor to make with all hone≈øt diligence) we ≈øhall find any obligation lying upon us, to u≈øe larger mea≈øures of Ho≈øpitality, we a≈ø≈øure your Lord≈øhips we will be ju≈øt to that obligation, and for the future will fully ≈øatisfie it as we will any other point of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is Incumbent upon us as Fellows of the College.</p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66217:65"/>
                     <p>This we hope will ≈øatisfie your Lord≈øhips at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, and we humbly de≈øire of your Lord≈øhips to make, as we are a≈ø≈øured your Lord≈øhips will do, a fair and Candid Interpretation of this An≈øwer to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Maje≈øty, whom God ble≈øs with long Life and an happy and glorious Reign.</p>

                        <hi>Eliz.</hi> There happened a Sedition in <hi>Merton</hi> College.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66217:127"/>to be put into the place of him that was Dead or Re≈øigned.</p>
                     <p>The Arch-Bi≈øhop re≈øented this, and rejected all tho≈øe named by the Fellows, and before the end of <hi>March</hi> Nominated <hi>John Man</hi> ≈øometime Fellow of <hi>New</hi> College to be the Warden, who came to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> accompanyed with Dr. <hi>Babington</hi> the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. <hi>White</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>New</hi> College, but the Fellows refu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Admit him, ≈øo that on the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> he came accompanyed with the Vice-Chancellor, and <hi>Henry Norris</hi> of <hi>Witham,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Fo≈øter</hi> of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and with much difficulty the Gate was opened, Mr. <hi>Willi.

                     <p>By this it appears what power the Local Vi≈øitor had to Nominate and ≈øettle the Head of the College at his plea≈øure even contrary to the Ancient Statutes of the Society,<note place="margin">The ob≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon it.</note> how much more may we conceive, that the King hath power by his Mandate to Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and appoint the Head of any College as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and Supreme Vi≈øitor.</p>
                     <p>The Commi≈ø≈øion for Vi≈øitation continued ≈øtill, and in it great changes were made till all were reduced to a Conformity to the Queens Laws and plea≈øures, ≈øeveral Statutes were revoked, others amended or explained, all which great changes were by vertue of the Queens Commi≈ø≈øion.</p>

Upon all which con≈øiderations, be≈øides the Influence of private Councils, tho≈øe that are conver≈øant in the Hi≈øtories of former Ages will find, that not only Vi≈øitations have been appointed, but that ≈øeveral Princes have been Induced to alter the Statutes.</p>
                     <p>‚òû The true and adaequate Rea≈øon of all which hath been and ever will be, becau≈øe the Influence that the Univer≈øities have over the whole Kingdom is ≈øo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66217:130"/>great, upon the account that they are the Nur≈øeries not only of the Divines, but al≈øo of the Eminente≈øt Gentry, and of the Profe≈ø≈øors of the Laws. So that if tho≈øe In≈øtructors, of the Learned hopes of the after Ages, be not conformable to the Laws of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may Create great di≈øturbances to it, which it is the Wi≈ødom of all Princes to avoid. Whence the fundamental Rea≈øon may be given why the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns have re≈øerved this power, of Vi≈øitation of the Univer≈øities, and giving Laws, to them≈øelves ≈øolely, as being mo≈øt conducible to the Tranquility of their Reigns</p>
                     <p>The Judicious Reader is likewi≈øe de≈øired to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why I intermix not only this particular ≈øuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of the Prince over the Statutes of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øities with the Vi≈øitation of them or the Colleges, but likewi≈øe ≈øome matters more particularly relating to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College: the rea≈øon of which is, becau≈øe I would not di≈øorder the Series of time, and likewi≈øe, that I would render this Section as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory to the next Chapter, wherein I ≈øhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Treat of the Kings di≈øpen≈øing with Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity Statutes, for it ≈øeems to me a very natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence, that ≈øince the Sovereign can di≈øannul, alter or amend Statutes, he may ju≈øtly upon Emergencies Su≈øpend the Execution of them by Mandate; There being no greater difference betwixt the Will and Plea≈øure of the Prince in both, but that in the one he declares his plea≈øure under his Broad Seal, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners of his own ≈øole appointment to in≈øpect and alter them; and in the other he by his Royal Fiat Commands the Execution of his plea≈øure.

                        </note> the Pre≈øident Dr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> called a Meeting of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Senior Fellows in order to proceed to an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new Dean; Tho≈øe being met Mr. <hi>Thomas Cole,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Powel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry We≈øt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Lumbard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walter Enderby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ralph Smith,</hi> denyed to take the u≈øual Oath praevious to the Election, for which they Alledged that Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brichenden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ichforbis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> were not Statutable Fellows, as having neither taken Holy Orders nor taken Degrees in Law or Phy≈øic, as they were obliged in a certain time to do by the Founders Statutes; ≈øo that they being <hi>non Socii</hi> could not be Electors; ≈øo that the fore≈øaid Six denyed to proceed, unle≈øs Four at lea≈øt of the Five be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Named, either would prove their Right to their Fellow≈øhips pre≈øently by the Statutes, or ≈øpeedily by Interpretation of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitor, and the Six ≈øaid, they did not deny to proceed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66217:132"/>to Election, which was not nece≈ø≈øary to be made at that time, but by their Statutes might be Po≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned till the end of their Audit, if the Lawful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors were pre≈øent.</p>
                     <p>The Pre≈øident Dr. <hi>Humfry</hi> finding the Six In≈øi≈øted upon the Plea, the third day he Summoned them; having cau≈øed the Statute to be Read to them of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øion, if they denyed to proceed to Election, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them Expelled, and ≈øo went his way out of the Hall without Naming or Electing any Dean.</p>
                     <p>This was about <hi>July Anno</hi> 1575. There are ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Papers which give an account of the Rea≈øons why the Six In≈øi≈øted on the Plea, Two of which, as containing the matter mo≈øt fully I ≈øhall annex, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Tran≈øcript of the Statutes Alledged, becau≈øe the matter ≈øeems to me ≈øomething curious, and gives ≈øome light into the Con≈øtitution of the College.</p>
                     <p>The following Paper is a ju≈øtification of the Expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fellows, which I could not ≈øo fully expre≈øs as in their own words.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I have not found among the≈øe Papers what was the I≈ø≈øue of this great Controver≈øie, but from what doth appear, make the≈øe following remarks.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="8" type="subsection">
                     <head>¬ß. 8. The fir≈øt ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from the≈øe ≈øhort Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</head>
                     <p>Upon the whole matter we may ob≈øerve, Fir≈øt, That the≈øe ≈øtrict and Indi≈øpen≈øable Statutes in former times as well as now, and in all times to come, have and will Create great troubles in this College, unle≈øs there be in the Sovereign a Vi≈øitatorial as well as Di≈øpen≈øing Power to Terminate endle≈øs Quarrels, when, as in this Ca≈øe, both Parties ≈øhall in≈øi≈øt upon Grammatical and Literal ≈øen≈øe of the Statutes, and tho' the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øtr</hi> hath a power of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, yet he is ≈øo tyed up to the Literal and Grammatical ≈øen≈øe, that he mu≈øt unavoidably be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66217:139"/>put ≈øome times to great ≈øtreights to determin mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>‚òû Secondly, However Rigidly the Statutes ≈øeem to be worded, yet none can Judge, that the Kings Di≈øpen≈øing Power can be re≈øtrained, ≈øince neither the Founder could ≈øo bind either his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign or the Pope, nor could any of tho≈øe bind their Succe≈ø≈øors by any Charter or Grant from ≈øuch inhaer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prerogatives annexed to their very Offices; as I ≈øhall make clear when I come to con≈øider the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments u≈øed concerning the force of the≈øe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
                     <p>‚òû Therefore Thirdly, I rather Judge, that the Founder (as Entaylers of E≈øtates upon their Po≈øterity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve <hi>nodo≈øam Aeternitatem</hi> often do) had a great de≈øire that his Statutes ≈øhould be perpetually ob≈øerved, but he could not be ≈øuppo≈øed to have ≈øuch an over ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinion of his own prudence, but that ≈øome Ca≈øes might happen whereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi> might Judge it convenient to alter them; ≈øo that I Rea≈øonably think the utmo≈øt of his de≈øign and hopes might be, that the Society it ≈øelf ≈øhould not have the power of altering them; but to Exclude the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, by their Prerogative or Acts of Parliament to Su≈øpend, alter, or Abrogate them, was as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his power to enjoyn, as it was vanity in him to pre≈øume would thereby be effected.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the Secretaries Letter we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, that he threatens the Queens Authority, if the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter,</hi> their Vi≈øitor, would not do the Fellows Ju≈øtice, and in the Bi≈øhops Letter to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øident he Su≈øpends all tho≈øe on both parties, from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Voices in the next Election, which mu≈øt be a force upon the Statutes for Election, if the Bi≈øhop
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66217:140"/>could not Interpret their Statutes but in the Literal and Grammatical ≈øen≈øe; for it is very probable it might be known by a Literal and Grammatical ≈øen≈øe whether they were Fellows or not, and if they were Fellows the Pre≈øident was as much bound by Oath to Admit their Voices as they obliged to give them, and if the per≈øons excepted again≈øt were no Fellows, then the Five were unlawfully Expelled, and ≈øo ought to have had Voices, ≈øo that whether way ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the matter were determined, I cannot conceive the Statutes or Interpretation was Literally and Grammatically ob≈øerved, which is the great plea of the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Fellows.</p>

                     <p>By this it appears what the Opinion of the Society was then, that the King was Supreme Vi≈øitor, and that the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> re≈øerved his Dioece≈øan Right, yet when he de≈øigned an extraordinary Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Fellows Appealed to the Apo≈øtolic See as Supreme, and I have cleared that what power that See had, is now in the King, according to the Laws.</p>

                     <p>To draw this matter to a Conclu≈øion;<note place="margin">The Conclu≈øion of this Section.</note> I ≈øhall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert the Opinion of an Eminent Lawyer concerning the Kings power over Corporations in general, and ≈øo over the Univer≈øities and private Colleges.

                     <p>
                        <q>The Body Natural is Created by God. Bodies Politic are Created by the King, and as they are Created and receive their Being, Life, and Strength from the King; ≈øo they are Governed by him, and by him are corrected and puni≈øhed for their Irregularities or mi≈ø-behaviors, either by ≈øeizure of their Liberties for a time: Or upon le≈øs occa≈øions than commonly are imagined for their Omi≈ø≈øions or Commi≈ø≈øions, they may be Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and di≈øolved at his Maje≈øties Suit in a <hi>Quo
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66217:146"/>Warranto;</hi> as lately was done in the Ca≈øe of the City of <hi>London,</hi> which was not only the greate≈øt, and perhaps the Anciente≈øt Corporation in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but was fortified al≈øo by many Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Ancient pre≈øcription and cu≈øtom, and yet not all ≈øufficient to defend them again≈øt the King, tho' the Offences for which they were di≈ø≈øolved, were not of the greate≈øt Magnitude.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There is no Corporation what≈øoever, Lay or Spiritual, ≈øaith the ≈øame Judici√≤us per≈øon, but is lyable to a <hi>Quo Warranto.</hi> Therefore the King was merciful to <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, that he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed again≈øt them by that Method.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There are no Corporations, which are the Kings Creatures, but have ≈øinned again≈øt him to their own de≈øtruction, if they ≈øhould narrowly be looked into; as there are no Men but have ≈øinned again≈øt God: and if the King had not power, upon ju≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to di≈ø≈øolve them, every Corporation would be in the nature of an Independent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The King is Supreme Ordinary, Vi≈øitor, Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Regulator of all Charities; Therefore every day in Chancery he doth by his Chancellor in the Name of his Atturny General Regulate, Correct, and ≈øettle Charities, and when any per≈øon, of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Intention, is mi≈øtaken in the end, or object of his Charity, the mi≈øtake in Chancery is frequently corrected, and that which the Donor intended one way is there applyed or di≈øpo≈øed another way, and to another per≈øon, of which there are frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not doubting but all this is according to Law; how can it be thought, that the King hath not the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66217:146"/>≈øame power over Univer≈øities and Colleges, only in other Corporations the Tryal is before the Judges of the Kings Bench, who are his Mini≈øterial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and in Univer≈øities and Colleges it is done by the Kings Mandate, or his Commi≈ø≈øioners, which are but various methods of exerting the Kings power? and I think the Judgment of another great Lawyer, will be granted, that where Statutes are made upon branches of the Kings Prerogative, they are remedial and take not away the Kings concurrent power, as may be ≈øeen in <hi>Colt</hi> and <hi>Glovers</hi> Ca≈øe in my Lord <hi>Hoberts</hi> Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 146.</p>

                     <p>It is then Fir≈øt to be noted from the Act,<note place="margin">The Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerci≈øed a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øing power.</note> 
                        <q>that the Pope claimed by U≈øurpation, as it is there Styled, and per≈øuaded the Subjects that he had a power to di≈øpen≈øe with all Human Laws, yea, and Cu≈øtoms of all Realms in all Cau≈øes which he called Spiritual.</q> But the ≈øame Act ≈øaith, <q>that ≈øuch claim of the Pope was in Derogation of the Kings Imperial Crown and Authority Royal, contrary to Right and Rea≈øon.<note place="margin">The power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerci≈øed by the ≈øufferance of the King and in derogation of the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> Therefore in the clo≈øe of this Section it is added ‚Äî that becau≈øe it is now in the≈øe days pre≈øent ≈øeen, that the State, Dignity, Superiority, Reputation, and Authority of the ≈øaid Imperial Crown of this Realm, by the long ≈øufferance of the ≈øaid unrea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and un-charitable u≈øurpations and exactions, practi≈øed in the times of the Kings mo≈øt Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors is much and ≈øore decayed, and dimini≈øhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That the Pope did here, by his Bulls and Breves grant Di≈øpen≈øations in various Ca≈øes, Erected,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66217:153"/>Con≈øtituted and Vi≈øited Colleges, and Abrogated their Statutes, as I have cleared in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by this Act the Popes General or Univer≈øal power and Authority in <hi>England</hi> in all Ca≈øes was Totally aboli≈øhed and taken away from him, as to the excerci≈øe of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ≈øome part only of that general power and Authority, which was excerci≈øed by the Pope, was by that Act Ve≈øted, Lodged, and Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in and to the Arch-Bi≈øhop, as the di≈øpen≈øing power for Marriages, Ba≈øtardy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there expre≈ø≈øed, which was properly to be called the Popes ordinary power; and was ≈øo lodged, and delegated in the Arch-Bi≈øhop, to ≈øave the King from trouble in ≈øuch ordinary and common Ca≈øes, but not to take away the Kings ordinary power &amp; Supremacy.</p>
                     <p>

Becau≈øe ≈øuch powers being taken away from the Pope, and ≈øuch as had Authority under him, and neither ≈øettled in any Court or per≈øon by the Statute, can re-ve≈øt or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66217:153"/>re-≈øult to none other but the King as Supreme in all Eccle≈øia≈øtical, as well as Temporal Cau≈øes, which by Sufferance or U≈øurpation, as the Act ≈øaith, the Pope had excerci≈øed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By the ≈øeveral Acts and In≈øtances, whereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ≈øince the making of this Act of the <hi>25th.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> have exerted their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, it is clear that the Crowns Re-a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption of what the Pope had exerci≈øed, hath been according to the Laws in being; of which I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give In≈øtances in the Kings di≈øpen≈øing with College Statutes, of which I ≈øhall give ≈øome few, in ≈øeveral Ca≈øes, of many hundreds which are to be found in the Paper Office, or Secretaries Books.</p>

                     <p>I rather believe ≈øuch Clau≈øes have been In≈øerted by Founders to prevent as much as in them lay, the Members of the Societies to Innovate matters, than that they could fore≈øee, that it was more obligatory by the addition of that Clau≈øe.

                     <p>A Second Objection I have met with is, that the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> being the Local Vi≈øitor appointed by the Statutes of Bi≈øhop <hi>Waynflet,</hi> it ≈øeemed more agreeable to a formal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he ≈øhould have exerci≈øed his power of Vi≈øitation before the King had ordered Dr. <hi>Hough, &amp;c.</hi> to have been proceeded again≈øt by the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners for Eccle≈øia≈øtical Cau≈øes.</p>
                     <p>To which I an≈øwer, Fir≈øt in the Re≈øolution of a very Eminent Lawyer, that the Local Vi≈øitor is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and tru≈øted by the Founder, and thereby hath a private Tru≈øt. But the King as King hath a public Tru≈øt by operation and con≈øtruction of Law, and by his Sovereign Authority and Juri≈ødiction is Supreme Vi≈øitor, and may exerci≈øe that Royal Tru≈øt (as tho≈øe of the long Robe u≈øe to expre≈øs his Prerogative ≈øometimes) when and as often as he plea≈øeth, without any Commanding or expecting the Vi≈øitation of the Local Vi≈øitor; and having the general care of, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66217:169"/>In≈øpection into the Manners and Duties of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may not only Vi≈øit, Enquire into, and Reform the Members of the College as to their Actions, but al≈øo Vi≈øit the Local Vi≈øitor him≈øelf as to his doing and performances in or about his Tru≈øt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is certain the Arch-Bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as I have by many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidents cleared before, have Vi≈øited, notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Local Vi≈øitors being appointed.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the ≈øpeedy Application of Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> to the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter,</hi> before I pre≈øume his Lord≈øhip could have notice of the Kings Inhibition, he had Admitted him, ≈øo that he was ≈øo far become a party concerned, that it was no ways convenient for him to have proceeded in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Local Vi≈øitor is appointed only for the ea≈øe of the Crown in ordinary Ca≈øes. But it cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed that if a Local Vi≈øitor ≈øhould neglect to do his Office, or ≈øhould be partial, there ≈øhould not be a power in the Sovereign to order the Vi≈øitor, ≈øeeing it would be a great deficiency in the Oeconomy of Government, that a power ≈øhould not be lodged ≈øome where to compel a Local Vi≈øitor to do his duty if he failed in it, which can ultimately remain in none but the King.</p>

                     <p>It is Fourthly objected,<note place="margin"> See here <hi>p.</hi> 67.</note> That Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected out of a Free hold for Life without any Writ of Ejectment or Tryal at Common-Law, contrary to the freedom of a Subject.</p>
                     <p>To this I An≈øwer, That there are two ≈øorts of Free-holds, <hi>viz.</hi> Ab≈øolute and Conditional; as to the fir≈øt it is true, that no per≈øon can be di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of it, but by due cour≈øe of Law, and in ca≈øe of re≈øi≈øtance no other way but by the Sheriff and his <hi>Po≈ø≈øe Comitatus.</hi> But in a Conditional or Attendant Free-hold as this
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66217:170"/>of a College is, a Man may be di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed without that Cour≈øe if he perform not the Condition of his Free-hold, ≈øo <hi>Thomas Coveney</hi> ≈øometime Pre≈øident of this College was deprived of his Free-hold Attendant on the Pre≈øident≈øhip, for that he was not entred into Holy Orders, and another ≈øub≈øtituted in his place without a Sheriff or <hi>Po≈ø≈øe Comitatus,</hi> for not performing ≈øome conditions required by his Office, tho' duly Elected. Therefore much more might Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> be Ejected by the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners Sentence, who never was <hi>de Jure</hi> Pre≈øident.</p>
                     <p>In this Ca≈øe the Free-hold is only Attendant upon the Office, ≈øo that by whatever Legal proceeding, the Office is declared and adjudged void, by the ≈øame the Attendant Free hold cea≈øeth, any more to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the per≈øon Ejected or Deprived. So a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon hath an Hou≈øe and Glebe-Land, and by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is ≈øu≈øpended or deprived <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> immediately his Right cea≈øeth, as to that Free-hold, during his ≈øu≈øpen≈øion or deprivation, yea it is more here, for he is as a per≈øon Dead.</p>
                     <p>So in any like Ca≈øe, an Officer that hath an Hou≈øe, Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> annexed to his Office, and holds that Office <hi>durante beneplacito Regis,</hi> this is his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold while he holds the Office, but when ever the King gives him a <hi>Super≈øedeas,</hi> the Free-hold Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon that Office from that moment cea≈øeth to be his Free-hold; now the Decree of the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners of Deprivation, Expul≈øion or Su≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øion is as much a final Judgment again≈øt Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> who≈øe Cau≈øe was of their Cognizance, as any Verdict in a Court of Common Law for Ejectment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>It is Fifthly objected, that it doth not plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that a Mandate implyes a Prohibition, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the per≈øon propo≈øed is by the Statutes of the College in no capacity to be Elected, it being, as Dr. <hi>Stafford</hi> urged,<note place="margin">See here <hi>p.</hi> 78.</note> a contradiction in <hi>Terminis, that to Command to Elect a per≈øon uncapable, ≈øhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige not to Elect a per≈øon capable.</hi>

                     <p>To this fir≈øt I An≈øwer in General,<note place="margin">An≈øwer.</note> That the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date having tho≈øe expre≈øs words in it <hi>[Any Statute, Cu≈øtom of Con≈øtitution to the contrary in any wi≈øe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, wherewith we are Graciou≈øly plea≈øed to di≈øpen≈øe in that behalf]</hi> takes off all di≈øability from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to be Elected.

                     <p>As to the fir≈øt part the whole Di≈øcour≈øe hath been a Set of Arguments to prove by a Deduction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, the obedience that hath, or ought to have been payed to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in all Ca≈øes where they have In≈øi≈øted upon having their plea≈øure obeyed: And there is good rea≈øon for it, ≈øince there hath been either an<note n="*" place="margin">So I find that King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally re≈øerved to him≈øelf and Succe≈ø≈øors, the power of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øing with any of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made or to be made, as appears in a di≈øpen≈øation for Re≈øidence granted to Dr. <hi>Blanford,</hi> 21 <hi>Aug.</hi> 1663.</note> Expre≈øs or Tacit re≈øerve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Con≈øtruction of the Law, in all the Grants made to the Univer≈øities or particular Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Impowring them to make Statutes, that the Kings ≈øhould have a power to alter, change, amend, abrogate, or annul them at their plea≈øure.</p>
                     <p>However the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have by their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conce≈ø≈øions in other particulars limited their power to act conformable to Laws made: Yet in this particular of College Statutes, it may be truly ≈øaid of them, as of the Roman Emperors, what<note n="(a)" place="margin">Quicquid principi placet, legis habet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorem in≈øtit. de lege naturali ¬ß. ≈øed.</note> ever plea≈øeth the Prince hath the force of a Law, as may be ≈øeen <hi>Cod. de con≈øtit. principis l.</hi> 1. <hi>In principe &amp; In≈øtit de lege naturali ¬ß. ≈øed.</hi>

                     <p>It is Ninthly Objected, that tho' it be allowed that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ≈øometimes di≈øpen≈øed with College Statutes, and done tho≈øe things I have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long In≈øtanced in; yet that proves not the Right or Ju≈øtice of the thing; ≈øince <hi>√† facto ad jus, non valet con≈øequentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I An≈øwer,<note place="margin">The An≈øwer.</note> there is a va≈øt di≈ø-proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Acts of Kings, and of Subjects. Con≈øtant and un-interrupted u≈øage are the Foundations of the Cu≈øtoms of <hi>England,</hi> which are Incorporated into the Common Law of the Land, and ≈øo many Rights are determined for private per≈øons. But in the Orders of the Sovereign, one declaration of his plea≈øure by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, in ≈øeveral Ca≈øes is ≈øufficient Precedent, tho' but rarely made u≈øe of, upon the pre≈øumption in Law, that ≈øuch Acts of Kings are not without deliberate con≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. However the con≈øtant practice of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which I hope I have fully proved, takes away all colour for this Argument: And it is mo≈øt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66217:183"/>certain, if the Kings di≈øpen≈øing power with Statutes, and putting in Heads of Colleges, Fellows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Mandates,<note place="margin">If the Kings Prerogative in this Ca≈øe had been again≈øt Law, it would have been que≈øtioned at ≈øome time.</note> had been again≈øt the Law, we ≈øhould at ≈øome time or other heard of Actions brought before the Judges, again≈øt the Kings Authority in that matter, and found determinations upon them in favor of the aggrieved, which I think is not to be found. But the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in all Ages,<note place="margin">The King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> tho' mo≈øt con≈øpicuou≈øly ≈øince the Reformation, and ≈øo this Prerogative mu≈øt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to appertain to the King, till by ≈øome Legal Tryal it ≈øhall be determined otherwi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>It may be upon this Topick rationally urged, that tho' the Kings di≈øpen≈øing power in other matters be in the Law Books only made out in ≈øome particular Ca≈øes; yet tho≈øe ≈øufficiently prove that the Original Prerogative of Di≈øpen≈øation being in the King;<note place="margin">The Original Prerogative of di≈øpen≈øing in the King.</note> it may branch it ≈øelf to all ≈øuch matters as the King plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to apply it to, which by no particular Act he or his Predece≈ø≈øors, as far as they can oblige him, have debarred them≈øelves from the exerci≈øe of, and the continual Series of this di≈øpen≈øing ≈øometime in one &amp; other times in a fre≈øh matter, is ≈øufficient evidence that our Kings have not given up this Prerogative wholly.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone through the mo≈øt material Objections I have met with in the Vindication of the di≈ø-obedience of the Fellows.

               <p>By this Record it is manife≈øt, that the King by Mandate could re≈øtore a Graduate who had been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Univer≈øity, and by parity of rea≈øon he mu≈øt have the ≈øame Right to place any in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity according to his Royal plea≈øure; and whereas by this Expul≈øion there was a Su≈øpen≈øion of his Degree, the King Capacitates him to receive it, when the time required by the Statutes of the Univer≈øity was expired, altho' he was thus di≈ø-enabled.</p>
               <p>So that in this one precept four particulars of the Kings Prerogative over the Univer≈øity are A≈ø≈øerted expre≈øly,<note place="margin">The preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the King over the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity, cleared in four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by this Mandate.</note> which in the foregoing parts of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe I have by other In≈øtances cleared, <hi>viz.</hi> Fir≈øt that the King is Supreme Vi≈øitor, to alter at his plea≈øure the Sentences, Decrees, or determinations of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity. Secondly, that tho' the Univer≈øity by their Statutes might ≈øtop a Graduate from taking an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degree, yet the King at his plea≈øure might re≈øtore him to his Pri≈øtin State, and make him capable of receiving his Degrees at the time limited by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Thirdly, that the King did this without any formal proceedings at Law, but by his own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority and plea≈øure only declared in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. Fourthly, that if the Chancellor did refu≈øe to obey the Mandate, the King threatens to have his plea≈øure fulfilled by his Royal power.</p>

               <p>How this Statute hath been ob≈øerved, appears by the late pulling down and Selling the Materials of the College of <hi>Brakley</hi> in <hi>Northampton-≈øhire,</hi> which by the Founder was built as a place for the Members of the College to Inhabit in and pur≈øue their Studies, in ca≈øe Fire or Plague, or any other public Calamity might enforce the Scholars and Fellows to remove from the College at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

By ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statute <hi>de Re≈øidentia Sociorum,</hi> they were tyed to ≈øtrict Re≈øidence, ≈øo that they could not go abroad to have conver≈øation and obtain the advantages that a relaxation of that ≈øtrict Re≈øidence might have
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66217:193"/>afforded them, whereby they might have made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion for them≈øelves in obtaining Benefices, in ca≈øe there ≈øhould none fall in the Interim.</p>
               <p>Now it ≈øo hapned, that the Founder had not annexed a ≈øufficient number of Spiritual Benefices, ≈øo that ≈øome of them when Doctors of Divinity mu≈øt have left the College un-provided for.</p>
               <p>The≈øe con≈øiderations induced ≈øome of the Fellows to Petition for a di≈øpen≈øation with this Statute; and upon the ≈øugge≈øtions in that Petition, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt granted it.</p>
               <p>But it ≈øeems this di≈øpen≈øation was not ≈øo well liked by others, and even ≈øome of the fir≈øt Petitioners joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and exhibited this following Petition.</p>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:66217:193"/>the≈øe Rea≈øons, which we pre≈øume to tender to your Honor.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The main ground the former Petitioners went upon,<note place="margin">Nine Rea≈øons for this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was a per≈øua≈øion that either this was no Statute, or not of like validity with the re≈øt, which upon full proof, (after long debating) being by the Heads of Colleges Confe≈ø≈øed to be otherwi≈øe, they did ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea≈øe their ≈øuit, and ≈øome of them became Petitioners that the ≈øaid Statute might be re-e≈øtabli≈øhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Ma≈øter by his Oath which he took at his Admi≈ø≈øion, is bound both to keep all the Statutes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably him≈øelf, as al≈øo to ≈øee the ≈øame done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which the Su≈øpen≈øion forbiddeth him in this Statute <hi>de Mor√¢ Sociorum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fellows by their Oath at their Admi≈ø≈øion are debarred from accepting any di≈øpen≈øation, either again≈øt any of the Founders Statutes, or again≈øt that their Oath: and thereby ≈øeem to be di≈øabled from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any benefit of this Su≈øpen≈øion expre≈øly containing a di≈øpen≈øation with the ≈øaid Oath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. None of the Fellows to our knowledge, was ever yet by vertue of the ≈øaid Statute turned out of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip unprovided, excepting one only of the pre≈øent Petitioners, who notwith≈øtanding before he left the College was provided of a good Par≈øonage, from whence he was ≈øince cho≈øen Ma≈øter of the ≈øaid College.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Since the Su≈øpen≈øion, ≈øix of the Fellows, before their time granted by Statute was expired, have been called to good Benefices with Pa≈øtoral charge, four of which were the Petitioners for the qualification of the ≈øaid Statute.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We conceive ju≈øt grounds of fear, partly by what we have heard, partly for other ≈øufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, that the ≈øaid Su≈øpen≈øion hath already been and may prove hereafter, a di≈øcouragement to tho≈øe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:66217:194"/>who otherwi≈øe would be Benefactors to our College.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Fellow≈øhips being but few in this College, if they be enlarged to perpetuity, younger Scholars will be di≈ø-couraged in their Studies, ≈øeeing ≈ømall hope of preferment for them, &amp; be forced to leave the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity before they be well fitted for a Pa≈øtoral charge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whereas our Honorable Founder Erected this College for a Nur≈øery to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and expre≈ø≈øeth this to have been his meaning, that tho≈øe who were brought up in it, ≈øhould upon a fair Call, be tran≈øplanted hence, after they were fitted for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry, the afore≈øaid liberty of longer continuance, will in likelihood, make ≈øome unwilling, to take on them a Pa≈øtoral charge being offered, whereby the Founders Pious intent ≈øhall be cro≈ø≈øed, the Church deprived of the labors of ≈øuch, and they ≈øhall not only remain unprofitable in the College, but al≈øo may in ≈øhort time draw to them≈øelves the Chief Government of the ≈øame, the Ma≈øter having no Negative voice to hinder it, as all other Ma≈øters of Colleges have.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Statute ≈øtanding in it's former force, would have prevented no ≈ømall di≈øturbances of the peace of the College which have lately hapened.</p>

               <head>¬ß. 14. Ob≈øervations upon this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
               <p>Upon this Petition King <hi>Charles the</hi> Fir≈øt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, referred the matter to the Vice-Chancellor and ≈øome Heads of Colleges, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, upon who≈øe report the King ≈øaw no rea≈øon to take off his di≈øpen≈øation; altho' the Grand≈øon of the Founder promi≈øed to add more Spiritual Benefices
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:66217:194"/>to the Revenue of the College, whereby the Fellows might be better provided for.</p>
               <p>Here fir≈øt we may note, that one part of the Oath which the Fellows take being in the≈øe words, ‚Äî <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam di≈øpen≈øationem contra Statuta fundatoris impetrabo, nec impetrari curabo, nec Impetratam acceptabo, viz.</hi> that they will neither obtain any di≈øpen≈øation contrary to the Statutes of the Founder, nor will endeavor that any other ≈øhould obtain them, or will accept of any ≈øuch being obtained, ≈øo that the Fellows of this College were under the like obligation as the≈øe of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College were.</p>
               <p>Yet Secondly they all own the Kings power in di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øing with this Statute, and only by way of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øhew their Rea≈øons why the King ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired to revoke it, but we hear of no per≈øi≈øting in the matter ≈øo as to cau≈øe the King to exerci≈øe his Supreme Authority to enforce their obedience; but pay a ready obedience, and that di≈øpen≈øation is in force to this day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is to be noted, that this di≈øpen≈øation was granted and yielded to, in a time when there were no public animo≈øities, or that any Factious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in the State Caballed again≈øt the Crown; but all was Calm, it being in the Halcyon Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt, and the Prerogative of the Crown was not di≈øputed. Therefore we ought to allow this as a mo≈øt Authentic Precedent of the Kings di≈øpen≈øing power, not for one or more ≈øingle per≈øons, but with an entire Statute which concerned the Succe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of ≈øeveral per≈øons in that, and in ≈øucceeding Ages.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As to the per≈øons that Petition, Dr. <hi>Sandcroft</hi> was then Ma≈øter, and Unkle to the pre≈øent Arch-Bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tuckney</hi> was in the time of the long Parliaments U≈øurpation Ma≈øter of St. <hi>Johns</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> Ma≈øter of

                  <hi>Trinity</hi> College, Dr. <hi>Bridge</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> were great Preachers, and Daemagogs of that Parliament.</p>

               <p>I ≈øhall now clo≈øe this with an Account which the Learned Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> Regius Phy≈øic Profe≈ø≈øor in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> hath given me at my de≈øire when he was at the la≈øt Commencement ‚Äî <q>That in Kings College in <hi>Cambridge</hi> they have a Statute that directs them to choo≈øe a Provo≈øt in ≈øuch Form, and with ≈øuch Qualifications as are appointed in the Statute, and by Oath are bound not to accept of any Di≈øpen≈øation to the contrary, yet from the very Foundation by King <hi>H.</hi> 6. the Provo≈øt was ever named by the King to be cho≈øen by the Fellows, and it hath been ≈øo con≈øtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ob≈øerved. The Fellows, as the pre≈øent Provo≈øt informs, put up a Petition to King <hi>James</hi> the Fir≈øt, that he would be Graciou≈øly plea≈øed to leave them to their free choice: But his An≈øwer was, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was Abrogated by the very practice of the Founder, who Named two Provo≈øts Succe≈ø≈øively in his Life time, and by the con≈øtant practice of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings, and that he was their Founder, for that the King never Dyes, and he would not part with his Right of Nomination, but in other things would leave them to the free u≈øe of their Statutes.</q> Thus far the Doctors Letter.</p>
               <p>I might add many other Modern In≈øtances of the entire obedience payed to the Kings Mandates by Ma≈øters and Fellows of Colleges, and the unque≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablene≈øs of the Kings di≈øpen≈øing with Statutes in both Univer≈øities, and particularly in St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, but under≈øtanding that a Member of that College hath Writ a Tract on that Subject, I ≈øhall here Conclude.</p>
