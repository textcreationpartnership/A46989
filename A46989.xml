            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Judicious Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ſoon as His Majeſty had been pleaſed to lay His Commands upon me, to Collect materials for this Subject; I could not but reflect that it was to Treat of a matter that I knew not any had Writ upon before; and of ſuch a largeneſs, that it takes in not only the Caſe of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College but regards all other Corporations and Societies of that Conſtitution, and ſpreads it ſelf into ſome branches of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal: Wherefore the nature of the Thing requires a Treatiſe of me, not altogether unſuitable to the Dignity of the perſons concerned, <hi>viz.</hi> The King and the Univerſities, which would induce perſons of all Ranks to peruſe it, who deſire ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in a matter of ſuch importance both to the Prince and Subject.</p>
            <p>This ſuggeſted to me a neceſſity of enquiring into Records of preceding ages, and to render the Work, at leaſt, a Collection of various inſtances in ſeveral Caſes of Viſitations.</p>
            <p>Therefore finding no compleat Hiſtory of any Viſitation of our Univerſities, except that of the long Parliament, I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it neceſſary to give an Impartial account of the proceedings, from the Kings Mandate for Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> to the cloſe of the Viſitations by the Lords Commiſſioners; whereby, this and after
<pb facs="tcp:66217:3"/>ages might have an Authentic Precedent, if any occaſion ſhould happen of this kind, and that people concerned might know their Boundaries; and in this part I followed the Regiſters, Original Papers, Authentic Copies of Letters and Orders, or the Diaries &amp; accounts of ſuch as were preſent, and actors in the diſquiſition; and in this particular I have uſed as much diligence as I could, not to be impoſed upon, and had finiſhed moſt of this before the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Relation was Printed; and wherein I differ from that, I have done it upon the beſt Intelligence I could obtain.</p>
            <p>After the finiſhing of this I judged it not improper, before I entred upon Anſwering the Objections I found urged by the Vice-Preſident and Fellows of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, to clear the Kings Prerogative over the Univerſities, in making, and Abrogating their Statutes, or diſpenſing with them, and placing or diſ placing of their Members, which obliged me to conſider the matter not only in General, but alſo to deſcend to many particulars, and ſhew, who by the Kings Authority or ſufferance have exerciſed the like Authority; In which I have endeavored to follow the moſt approved Authors, and ſureſt Records.</p>
            <p>I have the rather enlarged upon this head, that I might afford variety of Caſes, whereby the diſtinct claims of Right of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation might be Illuſtrated, and this Tract might be a Repertory, whereby, upon emergences, the Original Records might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</p>
            <p>If ſome may judge me too tedious, I deſire them to conſider, that it was not enough to clear the point of St. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> College, but likewiſe to diſcover in what other Caſes the
<pb facs="tcp:66217:3"/>Kings of <hi>England</hi> had exerted their Prerogatives.</p>
            <p>The Contemplation of this led me to touch, tho' with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand, the <hi>Regalia</hi> of our Kings, and look into the Laws and uſages of former times, and in what ſort the Soveraignty and Supremacy of our Kings in matters of Eccleſiaſtical cogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are declared by the Laws in being. In which part I treat of the Kings Authority abſtractedly from Doctrinal Religion.</p>
            <p>This I the rather have done, that the Subjects of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may obſerve how great the Authority and Prerogative of the King is, in diſpenſing with Univerſity and College Statutes, ſince by the plain and direct Laws that Aſſert the Kings Right, in oppoſition to all Foreign powers, his Supremacy is ſo Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Eccleſiaſtical matters and cauſes, that it is applicable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſes than at the firſt view may appear obvious, which I leave to the diſcuſſion of thoſe better verſed in the Laws than I ſhall ever preſume to be. Nevertheleſs I hope in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſubject, it will be owned, that I have Introduced no Novelty, but Copy'd what is found in Hiſtory or the public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and brought to light a Prerogative inſeparable from the Royal State of our Kings, which ſome for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the ſame have not ſo well diſcerned.</p>
            <p>It is to caution the Heads and Fellows of our moſt eminent Univerſities not to contend with their Sovereign, that I have ſo copiouſly produced Inſtances of the practice of former times, and have ſo largely treated of them before and ſince the Reformation.</p>
            <p>It was for this end ſolely, and not in the leaſt to erect Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies for any Victory over the unfortunate, that I have pointed out theſe Sea-marks, that others may avoid daſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:66217:4"/>againſt the Rock, upon which the Britiſh Monarchy is ſo firmly placed, that no Tempeſts of open Rebellion, or the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſwelling Seas, much leſs any ſingle Billow can be able to ſhake.</p>
            <p>It is far from my Intention in this, to enter into any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the limits of Eccleſiaſtical or Secular power: It is ſufficient that I ſhew it in ſome particulars of known practice; without examining the grounds, any more than as declared by the poſitive Laws or practice of the reſpective Sovereigns.</p>
            <p>I know ſome may look upon this as a matter treated of <hi>ex ſuperabundanti,</hi> yet I thought my ſelf obliged ſo far to enter into a diſſertation upon it, as I might thereby make it appear, that by the extenſiveneſs of the Sovereignty, Univerſities, much more private Colleges, (both which the Law accounts among the Creatures of the Crown) muſt own a ſubjection of themſelves and their private Statutes, to the King as Supreme.</p>
            <p>Neither hath it been any deſire to render the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive greater than the Laws and uſages of our Kings do manifeſt that I have ſhewn how it hath been inſiſted upon, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome exemptions of the Apoſtolic See, or to Eſtabliſh any Paradox; but only to Aſſert the juſt Rights of the Crown, at leaſt according to my Reading, and do with all deference ſubmit what I have compoſed, to the Judgment of the Learned in our Laws.</p>
            <p>But to leave this; I deſire the Candid Reader will peruſe the Contents of the Book in the following Pages, before he enter upon the whole, whereby he may ſee the connexion, and ſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:66217:4"/>of the matter; and he muſt not expect that thoſe Contents are exactly according to the Marginal Notes, but according to the matter treated in the ſeveral Paragraphs, and Pages; in ſome of which he will find ſome rectifyings of what by chance was miſ-printed.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe here give ſatisfaction to the Reader why I have added an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the whole, and thereby plead my excuſe, why this Treatiſe hath been ſo long Printed, in the greateſt part, before it was Publiſhed: The Reaſons of which are theſe in ſhort.</p>
            <p>Being deſirous to obtain an exact account from the Regiſters of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, concerning Dr. <hi>Haddons</hi> being Elected upon King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6ths. Mandate, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe was exactly Parallel to this in hand; I made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the late Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Vice-Preſident, but the Sickneſs and Death of the firſt, and the taking away of ſome Keys where the Regiſters were preſerved, hindred me from recieving ſatisfaction from the one or other: So that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſtop the Printing, I was forced to paſs by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with a Reference to treat of it after; and when by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying my ſelf to the Learned Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> Author of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of that Univerſity, I could get no other ſatisfaction, than appears by his Letter I have Printed: I begun to deſpair of retriving it, and ſo reſolved to have cloſed all without it: Yet being very unwilling to neglect any thing I could do in a matter of ſuch Importance, I applyed my ſelf to the Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Giffard,</hi> from whom, after his Lordſhips arrival I had ſmall encouragement; but at laſt after repeated ſollicitations,
<pb facs="tcp:66217:5"/>by his Lordſhips directions, and the induſtry of a Learned Gentleman, and Conference with Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> the Regiſter was found, but ſo late as the matter could not otherwiſe be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted but in an <hi>Appendix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble the Courteous Reader with the diſtinct Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why other matters are there likewiſe inſerted; but only in general, that ſome of them being committed to ſome hands that had miſ-layed them, or taken them with them upon ſome remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals from Town, I could not retrive them when the matters were Printing which they related to; and ſome few of them have come to my knowledge ſince Writing of the reſt: ſo that the Candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be deſired to place them according to the Notes in the Margents directing for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I muſt deſire the Reader will not peruſe this by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or come to the Reading of it with prejudice, aſſuring him the Author is free from paſſion and private deſign and hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to adhere to the Laws, for which purpoſe he hath ſhewn the whole to ſome of the eminenteſt in that Profeſſion, and hath had Approbation accordingly.</p>

                     <p>I Have Inſerted this Mandate at length as I ſhall the reſt of the Letters and Diſpatches, becauſe there being nothing that I know of Printed of a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereby the curious may be ſatisfied in the very Forms of Addreſs and Proceedings; I thought

Whereas I hope to make it appear, that the King might have proceeded in a ſummary way, and if he had pleaſed inflicted ſeverer puniſhments upon them than the Commiſſioners have done, and tho' at ſome times there ſeems to be a dutiful behavior in the Fellows, and expreſſions that were agreeable to the condition of humble Subjects, and a plea of tenderneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in not daring to break their Oaths, yet in effect whenever they were put upon a pinch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would yield to the King's Authority, and acknowledge themſelves to have acted contrary to their Duties, they never would own they had been in the wrong, which was the true cauſe why thoſe that refuſed to ſubſcribe the ſubmiſſion that was at laſt propoſed to them were ſo Expelled, and however ſome might at firſt Interpoſe for them, as the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> did in the following Letter; yet in the

                                 <p>IT is my opinion (for I will not pretend to call it by any other Name, much lefs by that of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) leaving every one here preſent to the liberty of his own judgment, that his Majeſty not having thought fit, upon our late Application to him, to Revoke his Royal Mandate, nor as we pray in the cloſe of the Petition, to leave us to our own choice, according to the direction of our Founders Statutes, nor to recommend ſuch a perſon as may be more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to his Majeſty and to the College: We moſt humbly Petition the King again, and repreſent the ſeveral reſpects referred to in our Petition, which render Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> incapable of being Elected, and admitted Preſident of the College. This Method and procedure being moſt prudent, and dutiful, and fit to be entered upon immediatly. The King having interpoſed his Royal pleaſure and Authority; which if it had not been done, I readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we not only might but ought to proceed to the Election of a Preſident in that very Inſtant, according to the expreſs Letter of the Statute in every particular. But for this, let every one concerned be his own Caſuiſt. Theſe are my private Thoughts, and upon mature deliberation: I conceive that I ſhould be very defective in my Duty to the King, and my Reſpect to you (whatever Miſ-interpretation ſome poſſibly may frame of it.) If I had not made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them at this meeting.</p>

                     <p>I Inſert this, for the honor of this Gentleman who is known by his Learned Writings, which give account of his Travels to the Port and through part of <hi>Greece,</hi> and in defence of the Doctrin of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> As alſo to let all know how happy it had been if the Fellows had hearkned to his honeſt, ſober and faithful advice, which was aſſented to by Dr. <hi>Aldworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pudſey</hi> at their private Conference before proceeding to Election, tho' they after changed their minds.</p>
                     <p>☞ It hath been the practice in former times, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canon Laws, that when any Superior enjoyned any matter upon Inferiors which they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be prejudicial to their Rights: It was their Duty <hi>reſcribere,</hi> to Write to the Prince, or other Superior to ſhew him wherein, by ſuch Mandate their Rights were invaded, or what other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences might enſue, and not to proceed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to do that which was forbid; eſpecially not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Election as here they did when the King had after their Petition preſented to him, expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he would be obeyed. In Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence therefore they ſhould have ſtayed their Election, and repreſented their Caſe more particularly, and it is moſt certain, that the neglect of this and the contempt of the Kings Authority were the Original cauſes of all that hath befallen them, but I ſhall leave this and proceed in the matters of Fact.</p>

                     <p>☞ By this it appears how ſedulous the new Elected Preſident and the Fellows were, to have the Election confirmed; preſuming, that this being done, the Preſident would have a Legal Right, and could not be removed but by courſe of Common Law: But I hope to ſhew hereafter, that the practice of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Viſitors appointed either by the Kings or the Popes (the latter of whoſe power our preſent Laws give his Majeſty) hath been to diſpenſe with Statutes, and to place, and diſplace for diſobedience, Heads of Colleges and Fellows by the ſignificaton of their Royal pleaſure, or to Impower Viſitors by Commiſſion to do the ſame; and of this it cannot be conceived, that the Members of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege could be Ignorant; but that they rather were animated to lay hold of this opportunity, to ſee if they could diſpute the Kings Authority, or which is of equal concern to many, render the King's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſobliging, whereby they might gain the point of raiſing iealouſie, and male-contentedneſs in peoples minds, with which deſigns I will not charge all the Members of the Society; But it is too apparent, that thoſe who underhand encourged them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their oppoſition, deſigned ſome ſuch matter.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66217:23"/>ſhall only note at preſent, that theſe were like to have little effect, ſince they were the juſtifyings of their actions upon ſuch ſlender grounds, as in the ſequel will be made appear, and carried no tokens of relenting or repentance for their by-paſt diſobedience, ſo that the King could not look upon them, as any Acts of theirs that might induce him to a Clemency or Pardon, where they would not own their failor of duty, but were a denial of his Sovereign and Supreme Authority of diſpenſing and being obeyed; contrary to the known Laws and practice of his Royal Predecſſors, as I ſhall make clear when I come to Anſwer their Objections, and ſhew the obligation to their Oaths of owning the Kings Supremacy and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction the King hath to alter and make null their Statutes that any ways Impugn his Prerogative over ſuch Societies, and Corporations; which owe their Foundation, and ſubſiſtence to the Royal pleaſure, and may be proceeded againſt, when the King pleaſeth, by a more ſever method of <hi>Quo Warrante;</hi> whereby they may be totally, ſuppreſſed: Whereas the King in great Clemency proceeded only by way of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is a moſt undoubted Prerogative of the King, that muſt ever be owned by thoſe who queſtion the extent of the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66217:24"/>to your Advice in all thoſe difficulties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are preſt; having, as we fear, diſpleaſed His Majeſty in our late Election of a Preſident, do humbly beg leave to repreſent to your Grace a true State of our Caſe, and hope you will pleaſe to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the King how uncapable we were of obeying his Commands.</p>
                                 <p>His Majeſty was pleaſed, upon the Death of Dr. <hi>Henry Clark</hi> Preſident of this College, to Command us by his Letter, to Elect, and Admit Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> into that Office, a perſon utterly uncapable of it by our Statutes, as we are ready to make appear in many particulars: And ſince we have all taken a poſitive Oath of obedience to them, and that Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all Diſpenſations whatſoever; We humbly conceive we could not obey that Command in favor of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> unleſs he had brought thoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications with him which our Founder requires in the perſon of the Preſident. And being confined as to the time of our Election, we have been forced to proceed to the Choice of one who has approved his Loyalty in the whole courſe of his Life, and whom we think Statutably qualified for the place.</p>
                                 <p>May it therefore pleaſe your Grace to Interpoſe with his Moſt Sacred Majeſty in our behalfs, that we may not lie under the weight of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for not being in a capacity of obeying his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. We know him to be a Prince of Eminent Juſtice, and Integrity, and therefore cannot think he would value any Inſtance of Duty to himſelf, which manifeſtly breaks in upon the obligation of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; And your Graces extraordinary unblemiſht Loyalty to the Crown, and that regard which we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelves, our moſt Honored Lord and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66217:24"/>has to the peace and well-fare of this place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces us to preſume your Grace will omit no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to ſet before his Majeſties Eyes the true reaſon and neceſſity of our proceedings.</p>

                     <p>They humbly beg leave to Repreſent, that there is an expreſs Clauſe in that Oath, which every Man takes when he is admitted Fellow of the College, wherein he Swears, neither to procure, accept, or make uſe of any Diſpenſation from his Oath, or any part thereof by whomſoever procured or by what Authority ſoever granted.</p>
                     <p>As to their former practice, when they have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in obedience to the Kings Letters heretofore, it has been always in ſuch Caſes where the perſons recommended have been every way qualified for this Office by their Statutes, in which caſes they always have been and ever will be ready to comply with His Majeſties pleaſure, it not being without unſpeakable regret that they diſobey the leaſt of His Commands.

                                 <p>That upon notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Clark,</hi> late Preſident of the ſaid College, the Vice-Preſident called a Meeting of the ſaid Fellows in order to appoint a day for Election of a new Preſident and the <hi>13th.</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> laſt, was the time prefixt, with power to prorogue the ſame as they ſhould ſee cauſe until the <hi>15th.</hi> day of the ſame Month, beyond which time they could not Statutably defer their Election, and in purſuance thereof a Citation or Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition was fixed upon the Chappel-door of the ſaid College, ſignifying the ſame, and by which the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Fellows are ſummoned to repair home to the ſaid Election, as the Statute in that caſe requires.</p>
                                 <p>And the ſaid Vice-Preſident and other deputed Fellows further ſay, that upon the <hi>11th.</hi> day of the ſaid Month of <hi>April</hi> they received His Majeſties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters requiring them to Elect and Admit the ſaid Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> to be Preſident of the ſaid College. But foraſmuch as the ſaid Vice-Preſident and the other Fellows apprehended the Right of Election to be in themſelves, and did believe His Majeſty never intended to diſpoſſeſs them of their Rights; And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> had never been Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, or of <hi>New</hi>-College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and had not thoſe qualifications which in and by the Statutes of the ſaid College are required in the Character of a Preſident, as they in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences did and do verily believe, and in regard they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66217:30"/>could not comply with His Majeſties Letters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the violation of their Oaths, and hazard of that Legal Intereſt and property, whereof they are by the ſaid Statutes poſſeſt, and which by their Oaths they are bound to maintain. They repreſented the ſame by their Humble Petition to His Majeſty, and having deferred their Election of a Preſident to the laſt day limited by their Statutes, they then proceeded to Election. And having firſt Received the Bleſſed Euchariſt, and taken the ſaid Oaths, as the Statutes require, to chooſe a perſon ſo qualified as is before expreſt, they did Elect the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Hough</hi> Batchellor in Divinity, and one of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the ſaid College, a perſon every way quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be their Preſident, who has been ſince Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> their Viſitor, as the Statutes of the ſaid College direct.</p>
                                 <p>And that they might not lie under His Majeſties diſpleaſure by their proceedings, on the <hi>19th.</hi> day of the ſaid Month of <hi>April</hi> they made humble Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation thereof to His Majeſty, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſetting forth their indiſpenſable obligation to obſerve their Founders Statutes.</p>
                                 <p>All which matters the ſaid Vice-Preſident, and other deputed Fellows, do humbly offer to your Lordſhips conſideration, and pray to be diſmiſſed with your Lordſhips favor.</p>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Thomas Atterbury</hi> Meſſenger, was ſent with this Order to the College, and he returns Anſwer <hi>June</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> that he came thither that day, and enquired for Dr. <hi>Pudſey</hi> who he underſtood was Senior Fellow upon the place, and told him that he was directed by the Lords Commiſſioners to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to him as Senior Fellow and deſired him to Aſſemble the reſt of the Fellows, that he might deliver to them the Orders from the ſaid Lords; Dr. <hi>Pudſey</hi> reply'd, That he did not Act as Senior Fellow, for that he was made Burſer, but would endeavor to get him an Anſwer at Five a Clock, as ſoon as Prayers were done, at which time he told him, that he had no power to Aſſemble the Fellows, neither could he any ways do it, ſo long as there was a Preſident on the place the Fellows had no Authority to Act; There being two or three Fellows with this Doctor, one of them asked Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> to ſee the Orders, to which he Anſwered: If he with Dr. <hi>Pudſey</hi> and the reſt would receive them he would deliver them to them, but would not Read them; So he ſhewed them the Indorſment, that they were directed to them, and offered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to them: But they refuſed, ſaying, they had no Authority to call an Aſſembly, neither could they do it, therefore it was not fit they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and being deſired to tell him, if that was their final Anſwer, they ſaid yes, ſo he told
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66217:37"/>Dr. <hi>Pudſey</hi> he muſt give a ſpeedy Anſwer to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> to whom he ſends this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and adds, that the Doctor treated him with very good words, and Invited him to Dine with them while he ſtayed in Town.</p>
                     <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi>'s Letter, I now proceed to what was done next.</p>

                     <p>I have omitted what paſſed betwixt His Majeſty and the Fellows of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College while the King was at <hi>Oxford;</hi> ſince there was nothing done by the Fellows which tended to a ſubmiſſion to the Kings Authority, but rather to a Juſtifying of their undutifulneſs in their Perſonal Addreſs to him, which as it was ſo contrary to expectation at a time when the King Honored their Univerſity with his Preſence, and was the only diſobligation he had met withall in his whole Royal Progreſs: It cannot be wondred, that he reſented it as he did, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fellows of a ſingle College ſhould perſiſt ſo in their diſobedience, in not Admitting the Biſhop of their Dioceſs to be their Preſident, an Honor they never had ſince their Foundation, if we may be allowed to call it an Honor to have a perſon of that Character their Supreme Governor.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore they were not required to <hi>Elect</hi> him, but only <hi>Admit</hi> him by vertue of the Kings Mandate, the King having by that ſuperſeded the

                                    <p>IF he who provokes the King to Anger ſins againſt his own Soul, what a Complicated miſchief is yours, who have done and repeated it in ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and Indecent manner as you have done, and upon ſuch a trifling occaſion? You were the firſt, and I hope will be the laſt, who did ever thus unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly provoke him. There is a great Reſpect and Reverence due to the Perſons of Kings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Contempt of his Authority in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, you were ſo unreaſonably Valiant as to have none of thoſe fears and jealouſies about you, which ought to poſſeſs all Subjects in their Princes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, with a due veneration of his Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. 'Tis neither good nor ſafe for any ſort of Men to be wiſer than their Governors; nor to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Lawful Commands of their Superiors, in ſuch a licentious manner, that if they ſometimes obey for wrath, they oftner diſobey, (as they pretend,) for Conſcience ſake. The King is God's Miniſter, he receives his Authority from him, and Governs for him here below; and God reſents all Indignities and injuries done to him, as done to himſelf. Now God hath ſet a Juſt and Gracious King over us, who has obliged us in ſuch a Princely manner, as to puzle our Underſtandings as well as our Gratitude; for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66217:46"/>he hath bound himſelf by his Sacred promiſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Altars, at which he does not Worſhip; and in the firſt place to maintain our Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops, and all the Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in their Rights Privileges and Endowments.</p>
                                    <p>No doubt but he will do his own Religion all the Right and Service he can, without unjuſt and cruel Methods, which he utterly abhors; and without wronging ours, which is by Law Eſtabliſhed; and by his own Sacred and free promiſes, which have been more than once renewed, and repeated to us, without our ſeeking or ſolliciting for them, which we, under ſome Princes, might have been put to crave upon our bended Knees. This is a moſt Royal and Voluntary Preſent the King hath made to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and calls for a ſuitable veneration from them; notwithſtanding the pretended <hi>Oxford</hi> Reaſons, which were Publiſh'd (by whoſe means and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors you beſt know,) to obſtruct it: As if the King had not Thorns enough growing in his Kingdom, without his Univerſities planting more. Now a Prince ſo exceedingly tender of his Honor as he is, ſo highly Juſt to all, and ſo kind beyond example to his Loyal Subjects and Servants of what perſuaſion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is one under whom you might have had all the eaſe, ſatisfaction, and ſecurity imaginable, if you had not been notoriouſly wanting to your ſelves, and under a vain pretence of acting for the preſervation of our Religion, you had not wilfully, againſt all Reaſon and Religion, expos'd it, (as much as in you lay,) to the greateſt ſcandal and apparent dangers Imaginable. Your diſingenuous, diſobliging, and petulant humor, your obſtinate and unreaſonable ſtifneſs, hath brought this preſent Viſitation upon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66217:46"/>you; and might juſtly have provoked His Majeſty to have done thoſe things in his diſpleaſure, which might have been more prejudicial to this, and other Societies, then you can eaſily imagin.</p>
                                    <p>But tho' you have been very irregular in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, yet the King is reſolved to be exactly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in his proceedings; And accordingly, as he is Supreme Ordinary of this Kingdom, which is his Inherent Right, of which he never can be diveſted, and the unqueſtionable Viſitor of all Colleges; he hath delegated his Commiſſioners with full Power to proceed according to the juſt meaſures of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws, and his Royal Prerogative againſt ſuch offenders as ſhall be found amongſt you, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                                    <p>'Tis a great grief to all ſober Men to ſee any, who would be thought True Sons of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> act like Men frighted out of their wits, and Religion, as you have certainly done.</p>
                                    <p>Never any True Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was, or will be diſobedient to his Prince; the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty which ſhe hath taught us, is abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional.

                                    <p>Yours, like all other Corporations, is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Crown; and how then durſt you make your Statutes ſpurn againſt their Maker? Is this your way to recommend and adorn our Religion, and not rather to make it odious; by practiſing that in ſuch a froward manner which our Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to abhor? Do we not pray for the King, as the Head of it under Chriſt? Do we not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for the Fountain of Honor? And does not

                                       <hi>Solomon</hi> Command his Sons to fear God and the King, the one with a Religious, the other with a Civil fear? Is he not the Lord's Annointed, and not to be toucht but with Reverence, either in his Crown or Perſon? And why ſhould we not render then to all their dues, Fear to whom Fear, and Honor to whom Honor? Is not this an Eternal tye both of Juſtice and Gratitude? For where the Word of a King is, there is Power; And who may ſay unto him, what doſt Thou? Are we not, next to God, and his Good Angels, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him for our ſafety, whoſe Honor and Lawful Authority We are now come to Vindicate? Is he not the Father of our Country, and ought he not to be more dear to Us than our Natural Parents; eſpecially conſidering how Indulgent he has been to Us, and what care he dayly takes to keep us from biting and devouring one another, we know not why. Is not he the Center of the Kingdom, and do not the concurrence of all Lines meet in him, and his fortunes; and how can we then underſtand the limits of ſelf love, if a tender Senſe of his Honor and happineſs be not deeply rooted and imprinted in our Souls? 'Twas neither dutifully nor wiſely done of you, to drive the King to a neceſſity of bringing this Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon you. And as it muſt needs grieve every Loyal and Religious Man in the Kingdom to the heart, to find Men of your Liberal Education and Parts ſo Untractable, and Refractory to ſo Gracious a Prince; ſo it will be very miſchievous to you, at the Great Day of Gods Viſitation; Who will then be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt looſers by your Contumacy: For God will Revenge this among your other Crimes, that you have behav'd your ſelves ſo ungratefully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Vicegerent, as to oppreſs his Royal Heart
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66217:47"/>with grief for your Stubbornneſs, to whom by your chearful Obedience, you ought to have adminiſtred much cauſe of rejoycing. They who Sow the Seeds of Diſobedience, have never any great reaſon to boaſt of their Harveſt, for whatſoever they vainly promiſe themſelves in the beginning, they are in the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and afraid of the Income of their evil Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and indeed every ſort of diſobedience hath ſo ill a report in the World, that even they who are guilty of it themſelves, do yet ſpeak ill of it in others: Let therefore the diſreputation, and Obloquy which it will inevitably bring upon you, make you out of Love with it; or if that will not do, let the Stings of your guilty Conſciences, and the fear of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance reſtrain you; or if you are ſtill Inſenſible of all theſe, yet at leaſt let the preſent fear of thoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhments, which the Laws of the Kingdom have ſuperadded to the Contemners of Gods and the Kings Authority, oblige every Soul that hears me this day to be Subject to the Higher Powers. If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a moſt Merciful God, nor a moſt Gracious King can pleaſe you, your wages will he recompence upon your own Heads: Were it not for this Serpent of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and jealouſies, which are now ſo buſie in it, this Kingdom would be like the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> before the Curſe, a Mirrour of proſperity and happineſs to all the World beſides, but this Serpentine humor of Stinging and Biting one another, and of Tempting Men to Rebel againſt God and the King, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who differ from us in Judgment are as happy as our ſelves, will as certainly turn us, as it did our firſt Parents, out of Paradiſe. Our Nation is in greater danger of being deſtroyed by Prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then Popery; by Sin, then by Superſtition; by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66217:48"/>other Iniquities, then by Idolatry; and I pray God we may not ſee Sacrilege once more committed under the pretence of abhorring Idols, as I my ſelf have ſeen in this place. If there be any among you who have ſinn'd with ſo high a hand againſt our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, as the obdurate Jews did againſt our Saviour, ſaying, we will not have this Man to Rule over us; ſuch your petulant humor, ſuch your ſhameful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Ingratitude, will deſerve the juſt Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of this Court. What diſtempers this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is ſick of, which we are now come to viſit by the Kings Commiſſion, your ſelves are beſt able to tell us: We are informed of too many already, and yet we ſuſpect there may be more; and therefore be but Ingenuous, and make a Conſcience of giving us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Anſwers, and you ſhall find, that we will abate nothing of the juſt meaſures of our Duty for fear or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, to ſatisfie the Importunities of any Man; being well aſſured that God and the King will bear us out. I am ſorry that you ſhould any of you run ſo far upon the ſcore of the Kings Royal Patience and Pardon, as ſome of you have already done; And that you ſhould be in ſuch vaſt Arrears of Duty and Reſpect to him as you are. But they go far who never turn: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence you may have upon other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, makes me Charitably hope, that your future Fidelity, and Allegiance will for ever Anſwer your Duty, and the Kings juſt Expectation; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope it will not be in vain for me to exhort you in the Bowels of Chriſt to a more entire ſubmiſſion, and obedience; becauſe if ſuch Men as you, bred in ſo Famous an Univerſity, are not thoroughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the neceſſity of it; the more Popular you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the more pernicious will you be in encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66217:48"/>your deluded Admirers, who have their Eyes upon you from all parts of the Kingdom, to be as Diſobedient and Contumacious as your ſelves: by which the Honor and Authority of the King may be diminiſhed, and the peace both of Church and State come to be endanger'd. Obey them who have the Rule over you, either in Church or State, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves before it be too late; for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious behaviour towards them will yeild you no profit at all; but your Obedience much every way; the former will prove like the Sin of Witch-craft, but the latter will be better accepted than Sacrifice, becauſe in that you only offer up a beaſt to God, but in this you Sacrifice your Paſſions, you ſlay them and offer them up to Gods ſervice. Remember Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſeldom goes in Company with Obedience, and that none are ſo likely to find the way to Eternal happineſs in the end, as they who follow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Superiors from the beginning; not with Eye ſervice, as Men pleaſers; but in ſingleneſs of Heart, Fearing God and the King; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do, do it heartily; as unto the Lord, and not unto us Men: And the Lord give you underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things.</p>

                        <p>To which he Anſwered, that there is not, neither can there be, any Preſident whilſt he Lives, and obeys the Laws of the Land and the Statutes of the place, and therefore doth not think it reaſonable to give up his Right, nor the Keys and his Lodgings now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him. He takes the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to be his Ordinary Viſitor, and yet he would deny him the Keys [he takes the King to be his Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Viſitor as he believes, but it had been contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted whether the King had Power to Viſit, as in <hi>Coveny</hi>'s Caſe, 4<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 
                           <hi>Eliz.</hi>] and looked upon their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Commanding it to be a requiring him to deliver up his Office.</p>
                        <p>He ſaid, he had appeared before their Lordſhips as Judges, and that he now Addreſſed himſelf to them as Men of Honor, and Gentlemen, and did beſeech them to repreſent him as Dutiful to His Majeſty to the laſt degree, as he always will be where his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience permits to the laſt Moment of his Life, and when he is Diſpoſſeſt here he hopes they will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, that he may no longer lie under His Majeſties diſpleaſure, or be frowned upon by his Prince which would be the greateſt affliction, that could befall him in this World.</p>
                        <p>Then their Lordſhips admoniſh'd him three times to depart peaceably from the Preſidents Lodgings, and to Act no more as Preſident or pretended Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the College in Contempt of the King and his Authority: which he refuſing to do, [Mr. <hi>Lee</hi>

                           </note> which was thus pronounced; The Lords Commiſſioners for Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, and for Viſiting the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have Decreed the Preſidents place of this College to be Null and Void: Therefore we by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to us committed, do Order and Command you Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> forthwith] to quit all pretenſions to the ſaid Office, upon which they Ordered his Name to be ſtruck out of the Buttry-Book, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and admoniſhed the Fellows and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Members of the Society, no longer to own him as their Preſident.</p>
                        <p>Then the Kings Mandate for Admitting the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> was Read,<note place="margin">See for this, <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. § 3.</note> and they were then Ordered to withdraw, and being ſoon after called in again, the Queſtion was put to the Fellows ſingly, one by one, whether they would Admit the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> their Preſident according to the Kings, Mandate. Dr. <hi>Pudſey</hi> ſaid, he would ſubmit to the King, and would be by, but could not Act, being Burſer. Dr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> replyed,<note place="margin">From Dr. <hi>Smiths</hi> Diary.

Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> ſaid, he was ready to obey the Kings Mandate; all the reſt of the Fellows refuſed to receive him as Preſident, as being againſt their Statutes and Oaths, and that which would make them guilty of Perjury. All whoſe Verbal Anſwers were taken in Writing by the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and their Lordſhips after ſome time ſaid, if you think we have not taken the Anſwer right put
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66217:53"/>them in Writing your ſelves againſt the Afternoon, to which time they adjourned the Court.</p>
                        <p>The Court being Sate in the Afternoon,<note place="margin">Afternoon.</note> Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> appeared with a great Rabble of followers, and after a ſhort time ſaid, whereas your Lordſhips this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have been pleaſed, purſuant to the former Decree of the Lords Commiſſioners, to deprive me of my place of Preſident of this College, and to ſtrike my Name out of the Buttry-Book: I do hereby proteſt againſt the ſaid proceedings, and againſt all that you have done, or hereafter ſhall do in prejudice of me and my Right, as Illegal, Unjuſt and Null, and I do hereby Appeal to our Sovereign Lord the King in his Courts of Juſtice.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tho.

Upon which he was bound in a Thouſand pound Bond, and his Sureties in Five Hundred pound a piece.</p>
                        <p>Then the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> gave-the Doctor this Anſwer to his Appeal, Doctor, we look upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal as to the matter and manner of it to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and not to be admitted by us: Firſt, becauſe it is in a Viſitation where no Appeal is allowable:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66217:53"/>Secondly, becauſe our Viſitation is by Commiſſion under the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> which is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, therefore we over-rule this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and Appeal, and Admoniſh you once for all to avoid the College, and obey the Sentence.

The Fellows cannot be ſaid to be Guilty of any diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or diſloyalty in proceeding to the Election of another Perſon, who was qualified according to the Statutes, being forced to make an Election, for they are obliged by the Statutes of the College, when called together to Elect a Preſident or any other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, under pain of Expulſion perpetual from that College, to meet and make an Election, which Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment they Incur <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> who either refuſe to meet when ſo called, or being met do not Nominate and Elect a Perſon into the Office void, as appears by the Statutes of the College, <hi>Titulo de numero Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larium &amp; Electione Praeſidentis.</hi> Now according to the Founders direction in the ſaid Statute on the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt, the Fellows were called together by the Vice-Preſident to Elect a Preſident in the place of Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> Deceas'd.<note place="margin">The obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Oath will be examined.</note> The Oath required to be taken before the Election was Adminiſtred to them by the Vice-Preſident, whereby they are obliged to Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Elect a Perſon, that either is or has been Fellow of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College or <hi>New</hi>-College, which Oath when the Fellows had taken, it was not in their Power to Elect Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and yet then they were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66217:55"/>obliged to make an Election, under pain of perpetual Amotion from the College, as appears by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Statutes, and it cannot be imagined that His moſt Sacred Majeſty did expect, that the Fellows ſhould be either Perjur'd or forfeit their Right to their Fellowſhips rather then diſ-obey his Command.

                     <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John</hi> was diſſolved and the Lands thereunto belonging were purchaſed by <hi>William Wainfleet,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> and in the place or ſcite of that Hoſpital he Built <hi>Magdalen</hi> College.

But in the time of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion the ſaid Chappel, with the Vault, was made no other uſe of but to lay Fuel in, whereupon at the Reſtauration the Viſitor directed, that it ſhould be Converted into Chambers for the uſe of the Fellows and Demys.</p>
                     <p>Two other of their Benefactors, <hi>Ingledue</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> ordered 20 <hi>d.</hi> at a time, to be diſpoſed of on fourteen Feaſts to the poor, the whole amounting

                     <p>As to our Hoſpitality in General, the Burſers Table is the place where not only our Tenants, but Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, according to their Quality are Entertained, there being a dayly Allowance made by the College for that purpoſe, which when ſcanty, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a ſuitable Entertainment, it is left in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caſes to the diſcretion of the Burſers to add what they ſhall Judge fit and becoming. But beſides this it is our conſtant Practice and Cuſtom at the end of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66217:64"/>the Year to give Sums of Mony away to the poor, which are greater, or leſs, according to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of our Corn Rents that year.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Burſers are Impowered to give Mony away to the poor, upon the greater and more ſolemn Feſtivals of the year. Fourthly, Oftentimes upon great Emergencies, ſuch as were the Brief for the Re-edifying the Town of <hi>Northampton,</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building the Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> for the relief of the French Proteſtants, beſides other Briefs for Fires and for Redemption of Captives, and the like, we give conſiderable Sums of Mony, as well out of the public Stock, as out of our private Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>As for turning the remaining part of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John,</hi> about twenty Years ſince, into Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chambers, which were very much wanting for the Fellows, that alteration was not made without conſulting the Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> our Local Viſitor, and without having obtained his Lordſhips conſent. There having been no uſe as we could ever learn from our Predeceſſors of thoſe Rooms, and as we may ſeem, not without good grounds, to believe, ſince the Time that Pilgrimages were left off, and diſ-uſed here in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my Lords, if upon re-ſearch (which we will endeavor to make with all honeſt diligence) we ſhall find any obligation lying upon us, to uſe larger meaſures of Hoſpitality, we aſſure your Lordſhips we will be juſt to that obligation, and for the future will fully ſatisfie it as we will any other point of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is Incumbent upon us as Fellows of the College.</p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66217:65"/>
                     <p>This we hope will ſatisfie your Lordſhips at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and we humbly deſire of your Lordſhips to make, as we are aſſured your Lordſhips will do, a fair and Candid Interpretation of this Anſwer to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, whom God bleſs with long Life and an happy and glorious Reign.</p>

One would have thought that His Majeſties Patience after ſo many and great Provocations as theſe, ſhould have made a way to your Hearts through your Brains, and made you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of your obſtinacy and in love with obedience before now. But you have deceived his and all good Mens expectations ſtill. Inſomuch, that <hi>on Sunday the 4th. of September</hi> His Majeſty ſent for you to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him at <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and Commanded you to Admit the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> your Preſident without any further delay or pretence; you ſay it was to <hi>Elect</hi> him, which ſounds like the reſt of your Sophiſtry, for you well knew that <hi>admiſſion</hi> would have ſatisfied him, for which you had his <hi>Written Mandate lying by you,</hi> which would have determined that Scruple. But the truth of it was, you <hi>reſolv'd</hi> (as <hi>time</hi> the beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor of Mens intentions has <hi>diſcover'd</hi>) to perſiſt in your obſtinacy, till you had convinced him and others, that you were none of the good <hi>Centurions Servants,</hi> for inſtead of complying with His Majeſties Pleaſure,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66217:72"/>you went back to <hi>your Chappel</hi> (where you ſhould have <hi>learned and paid more Devotion</hi>) and Signed a Paper containing a direct and diſ-obedient refuſal.</p>
                                 <p>Which peeviſh carriage of yours to your Prince from one end to the other, is ſuch a Compoſition of folly and frowardneſs as was little deſerv'd by ſo good and Gracious a King. There ever went <hi>a Miraculous Power of Converſion with his Royal Preſence</hi> where ever he came in his whole Progreſs <hi>but here,</hi> he convinced <hi>all ſuch</hi> as he had diſcourſed with, of the Juſtice and equity of his Proceedings; <hi>your ſelves excepted,</hi> no body of Men ever departed unſatisfied from him, but that they departed from the bleſſing of enjoying his Royal preſence no longer. And I muſt confeſs I do not ſee how it is poſſible to do any thing more in point of Honor, Conſcience, Clemency, Juſtice and <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tenderneſs, for the preſervation of this Society and every Member of it,</hi> than what <hi>His Sacred Majeſty hath already done</hi> in ſpight of your <hi>Diſ-obedience</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, and yet <hi>he was and is ſtill reſolved</hi> to continue his Princely Piety and Goodneſs to all thoſe who ſhall no longer pretend to make it a ſin againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to return to their Obedience to him, and to thoſe whom he has ſet in Lawful Authority over them, of which I gave you a full account at the firſt opening of our Commiſſion on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>21ſt.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in your College Hall as you may well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> we required you to Admit and Inſtal my Lord of <hi>Oxon</hi> according to the Kings Mandate to you before directed, which all but three of you refuſed again to do, and gave your pretended Reaſons for it in the Morning, <hi>and in the Afternoon Dr.</hi> Hough, <hi>tho' before Expelled, came in without leave,</hi> but not <hi>without Attendance and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66217:72"/>unbecoming his Circumſtances,</hi> and Appealed from what we had done, or ſhould do, as <hi>Illegal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt and Null</hi> (<hi>by word of Mouth</hi> and not <hi>in Writing,</hi> nor with the decent <hi>ſalvo's</hi> of all other Appeals) which was applauded <hi>by a loud Tumultuous and Inſolent Hum,</hi> to affect the Populacy to the eſpouſing of your cauſe, for which <hi>open breach of the Peace, Dr.</hi> Hough was bound over to the Kings Bench, and if moſt of you had not been better pleaſed with that <hi>Inſolent behavior</hi> than became you (and indeed Acceſſaries to it, if not Actors in it) you <hi>might</hi> and <hi>would</hi> have <hi>diſcovered the Turbulent perſons</hi> who had been guilty of it.</p>
                                 <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> we our ſelves cauſed the Biſhop to be Inſtalled by his Proxy, and we then askt you, whether you would ſubmit to the Biſhop as your Preſident now Inſtalled by the Kings Mandate <hi>In lieitis &amp; honeſtis?</hi> To which all that were preſent (except Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi>) gave in an Anſwer <hi>in ſcriptis</hi> in the Affirmative, and requeſted us to repreſent you <hi>as Dutiful to</hi> His Majeſty in the <hi>higheſt degree:</hi> But from this <hi>good Reſolution</hi> you quickly <hi>fell:</hi> for on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> when we adviſed you to make an <hi>humble ſubmiſſion</hi> to His Majeſty according <hi>to the Nature of the Offence,</hi> it had ſo ill an effect upon you, that after an hours conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or more, you brought us down a Paper Signed by all but two or three of the Fellows then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which ſeemed to us to be rather a proteſtation againſt your <hi>former ſubmiſſion</hi> than a begging of the Kings Pardon for your paſt offences: and that you might <hi>clear your ſelves,</hi> at leaſt from any the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of that which lookt like <hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> you deſired to withdraw or expound your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which you made in writing the <hi>Tueſday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66217:73"/>and to limit the word <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the Kings Authority, telling us plainly, that you did not <hi>nor could not</hi> ſubmit to the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> as your Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preſident: With the <hi>Inſolent Juſtification</hi> of your continued diſ-obedience, we were <hi>deeply affected and aſtoniſhed,</hi> and tho' we might then juſtly have Expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, yet we forbore and <hi>went back to London</hi> to acquaint His Majeſty with your carriage, who <hi>reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it according to your Demerits.</hi> He who is too proud to ask God and the King Pardon, deſerves neither. I am ſure the beſt of us need both. I wiſh it had been in our Power to have perſuaded you then, ſo to have moderated your ſelves, as to have <hi>Sacrificed</hi> the moſt <hi>diſingenuous</hi> Arts of <hi>Contention</hi> to the ſafety and honor of the Chriſtian Religion, and not to have <hi>purſued your little ſcruples, and great Animoſities</hi> to the evident hazard at leaſt of bringing a ſcandal on it.</p>
                                 <p>I hope I have ſaid enough to convince you, that the <hi>Fig leaves,</hi> which you have ſtitched ſo Artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, will not <hi>cover your Nakedneſs:</hi> you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Conſcience of your <hi>Oaths,</hi> among which that of <hi>Allegiance and Supremacy</hi> ought not to have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. But <hi>partiality in Duty</hi> is a great Symptom of Hypocriſie. You Diſpenſe with your own Oaths your ſelves, and make too bold with ſome parts of your Founders Statutes, in which I have inſtanced, and could do in more, as in that wherein you are bound to be ſerved <hi>ſolum per Maſculos,</hi> for want of which we found ſome ſcandals to have been brought upon the College by Baſtard Children, and will you not ſuffer the King <hi>who alone hath Power to do it,</hi> to give you a Diſpenſation in others? Can he who is ſo tender of his Honor put up ſuch Indignities as theſe? And can we who are intruſted with the vindication of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66217:73"/>it, ſuffer this to go unpuniſhed? I wiſh you had half ſo much kindneſs and Charity for your ſelves, and ſo great a conſideration of the happineſs of this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as His Majeſty and his Commiſſioners have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready expreſt in their dealings with it. The Juſtice and Equity whereof (if you do not) all good Men will Proclaim. I need not remind you of putting in ſome Papers under your hands, which would have been Aggravations of the former Contempts, which upon better thoughts you deſired, and we gave you leave to withdraw. What other Men, who are led by Populacy (which is the <hi>Fools Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> but the <hi>Wiſe Mans ſcorn</hi>) ſay of us while we are doing <hi>our Duty to God and the King,</hi> we value no no more than what they dream of us: For we ſet a greater eſtimate upon our own <hi>Duty</hi> than <hi>other Mens thoughts,</hi> and will diſcharge our Conſciences faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, whatſoever becomes of our Credit. We can allow thoſe who are <hi>diſ-affected</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> and to <hi>the Church of</hi> England, to talk of us at their own Rate; we ſhall vindicate the Kings Authority, and redeem it from Contempt by all Juſt and Lawful means; But yet Gentlemen, the great concern we have for you, and our earneſt deſign <hi>to reſcue</hi> you out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (if you are not ſturdily reſolved to caſt away your ſelves) obliges us to offer you once for all, that if you will <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>preſently</hi> make ſuch <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to His Sacred Majeſty, as the <hi>Heinouſneſs</hi> of your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences do's <hi>in our Judgment require,</hi> we will paſs by your faults, and recommend you heartily to Gods and the Kings Mercy, and accordingly we require the Deputy Regiſter to Read the Form of ſuch a ſubmiſſion to you, as the Court upon mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration hath judged neceſſary for them to expect,

As to the firſt and ſecond, none of our Kings, either before or ſince the Reformation, took upon them at all to medle, either by aſſuming to themſelves a power of Preaching, Teaching, Binding or looſing in <hi>foro Animae,</hi> Adminiſtring the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Conferring Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they took upon them the Ordering of ſuch things as were of outward Policy of the Church, as what Men were fit to Exerciſe them, and what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the Subjects ſhould yield to Decrees and Conſtitutions made abroad, and what Doctrins were publicly to be Taught, which might conduce to the quiet Peace and Tranquility of the Subject, and their living in Piety and Vertue.</p>

                     <p>Upon the whole matter of this great conteſt about the Arch-Biſhops Viſitation, I think the King and the Parliament were at that time the more Inclined to confirm the Arch-Biſhops power, becauſe that kept the Viſitatorial power within the Kings Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and Excluded Exemptions, which the State of <hi>England</hi> was rarely inclined to favor, as being moſtly as prejudicial to the Crown as the Biſhops. And <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Doctrin ſpreading, the King was more willing the Arch-Biſhop ſhould Viſit the Univerſity, becauſe it was his proper Office to ſee to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, and if the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity had been left to the Viſitation of the Chancellor, the opinion of Mr. <hi>Wickliff</hi> might have the more encreaſed, ſince the temper of the Members might have been changed from the Doctrin profeſſed ſince ſo many in the Univerſity were then ſaid to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it.</p>

                     <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this particular for two Reaſons, firſt to ſhew that the Government, ordering, and reforming of Univerſities were then Judged to be of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance; eſpecially in thoſe matters which appertain to the Doctrins taught in them, which even in their Philoſophical Diſputes in ſome meaſure effected Religion, even the taking of Degrees, except in the faculty of Phyſic, was in <hi>Ordine ad Spiritualia;</hi> as appears in thoſe Conſtitutions which prohibit any from having Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices but ſuch as had taken Degrees in Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; a further Illuſtration of the former of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences I ſhall clear when I ſpeak of Biſhop <hi>Ripping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> Viſitation.</p>

                     <p>And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> ought further to have noted, that in the two-Roman Catholic Kings times the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Controverſie was, whether by the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Pope, the Univerſity ſhould be Viſited by the Chancellor only, or by the Arch-Biſhop as Metropolitan, who by the Canons had the Viſitation of his whole Province, as alſo the Dioeceſan had in matters at leaſt of Religion, as in Biſhop <hi>Rippingdons</hi> Viſitation I ſhall ſhew: ſo that the <hi>Cardo Controverſiae</hi> was upon the validity of the Popes Exemption, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66217:113"/>in all the Caſes there is a <hi>Salvo</hi> of the Kings Right; and ſuch application was made to him as ſhews, that the laſt reſort was to the Sovereign even to Judge of the Popes Bulls as before I have hinted.</p>

One Mr. <hi>Robert Haryſon</hi> ſometimes Fellow of the College there, was Expelled in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. and <hi>Thomas Greenway</hi> was made Preſident, who reſigning, the Fellows Elected <hi>Haryſon</hi> for their Preſident, tho' the Queen by her Mandate appointed Mr. <hi>William Cole</hi> who had been Fellow there, and baniſhed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time. This Mandate they ſlighted, and Elected as aforeſaid, with which the Queen being acquainted, ſhe declared the Election void, and expreſly Commanded them to Admit <hi>Cole.</hi> The Fellows reply'd, that they had done nothing but according to their Oath,<note place="margin">The Queens Mandate to the Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Cole</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> College contrary to the Election of the Fellows.</note> upon which the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoked that her Mandate was not obeyed, ſhe ſent Dr. <hi>Horn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> their Local Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Commanded him to ſee <hi>Cole</hi> Admitted. The College ſhut their Gates againſt the Biſhop, who cauſed them to be opened, and going to the Chappel and calling the Senior Fellows Admoniſhed them forthwith to Admit <hi>Cole,</hi> and they reſiſting he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced them Expelled putting others in their places, who he knew would obey the Queens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66217:129"/>and ſo placed him Preſident, and the Queen Commanded the Chancellor of the Univerſity,<note place="margin">In faſciculo Chartarum in Abba Aula.</note> the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Sir <hi>William Cecyl</hi> Secretary of State,<note place="margin">The Queen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points Viſitors.</note>

                     <p>In this particular it is to be noted, that Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> ſaith, the Viſitation is to be aſcribed to this Earl, and it is moſt clear, that whatever the Chancellor

                     <head>§. 1 The account of what is to be Treated of in this Section.</head>
                     <p>IN purſuance of my deſigned Method, I ſhall with what brevity I can give an account of the more Modern Viſitations of the Univerſities, or ſingle Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, ſo far as I Judge they may conduce to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under conſideration.</p>
                     <p>The Critical Reader is however deſired not to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me tho' in this Section I intermix ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Royal power in Abrogating, Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Amending or new framing of Statutes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as it was Judged more convenient to the better ordering of the Body of the Univerſity, as to their diſtinct Oeconomy, or the conformableneſs of their Members to the public Laws of the Realm, or the Political Government of the Prince. Upon all which conſiderations, beſides the Influence of private Councils, thoſe that are converſant in the Hiſtories of former Ages will find, that not only Viſitations have been appointed, but that ſeveral Princes have been Induced to alter the Statutes.</p>
                     <p>☞ The true and adaequate Reaſon of all which hath been and ever will be, becauſe the Influence that the Univerſities have over the whole Kingdom is ſo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66217:130"/>great, upon the account that they are the Nurſeries not only of the Divines, but alſo of the Eminenteſt Gentry, and of the Profeſſors of the Laws. So that if thoſe Inſtructors, of the Learned hopes of the after Ages, be not conformable to the Laws of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may Create great diſturbances to it, which it is the Wiſdom of all Princes to avoid. Whence the fundamental Reaſon may be given why the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns have reſerved this power, of Viſitation of the Univerſities, and giving Laws, to themſelves ſolely, as being moſt conducible to the Tranquility of their Reigns</p>
                     <p>The Judicious Reader is likewiſe deſired to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why I intermix not only this particular ſuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of the Prince over the Statutes of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities with the Viſitation of them or the Colleges, but likewiſe ſome matters more particularly relating to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College: the reaſon of which is, becauſe I would not diſorder the Series of time, and likewiſe, that I would render this Section as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory to the next Chapter, wherein I ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Treat of the Kings diſpenſing with Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity Statutes, for it ſeems to me a very natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that ſince the Sovereign can diſannul, alter or amend Statutes, he may juſtly upon Emergencies Suſpend the Execution of them by Mandate; There being no greater difference betwixt the Will and Pleaſure of the Prince in both, but that in the one he declares his pleaſure under his Broad Seal, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of his own ſole appointment to inſpect and alter them; and in the other he by his Royal Fiat Commands the Execution of his pleaſure. And what I bring in as to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College I do that the unreaſonableneſs of ſome of their Statutes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66217:130"/>may appear if there were no diſpenſing power in the Crown.</p>
                     <p>Having promiſed this, I now proceed.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66217:132"/>to Election, which was not neceſſary to be made at that time, but by their Statutes might be Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned till the end of their Audit, if the Lawful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors were preſent.</p>
                     <p>The Preſident Dr. <hi>Humfry</hi> finding the Six Inſiſted upon the Plea, the third day he Summoned them; having cauſed the Statute to be Read to them of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, if they denyed to proceed to Election, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them Expelled, and ſo went his way out of the Hall without Naming or Electing any Dean.</p>
                     <p>This was about <hi>July Anno</hi> 1575.

They have ſet it down ſo plainly, and in ſo good order, that if Truth be not there, I muſt needs Confeſs my ſelf as much deceived in this matter as ever was Man in any — your Lordſhip knows the Statutes, and I doubt not, but you will ſee by this their Anſwer and Depoſition, that the Statutes are more for them than the other— becauſe the Election draweth nigh and ſome ſtir perhaps may be about them; I pray you take ſuch Order, that either they may be fully ſettled, or elſe the other Five whoſe places are not reſolved of, may be Suſpended from all Voice, as well as theſe. — Then Concludes — Therefore I pray you my Lord take ſuch Order in the matter as Reaſon and Conſcience would, and relieve the oppreſſed againſt the wrong; aſſuring your Lordſhip, that if they cannot obtain it at your Hands they ſhall be heard, and I truſt obtain it elſewhere.

                     <p>The ſame Biſhop Writes another Letter to the Preſident, Informing him of the Receipt of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Letter, and adds — <q>I continue in my former
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66217:139"/>Opinion towards them, to wit, that I would be loth that they ſhould be Expelled, if by any means the Statutes may relieve them; and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you Mr. Preſident and the Fellows, that you chooſe none now at the next Election into their Rooms,<note place="margin">Here Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is payed to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Letter of advice.</note> but that their places may ſtand in the ſame Terms as they are, till I may hear what by you and them may further be ſpoken and conſidered by the Statutes, to the end the Statutes may be truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and in the mean ſeaſon no Men be of that Calling wronged — I have willed them to abſent themſelves from the next Election, for good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and my hopes is, that none of that Society will move any troubles in or about the Election, for any matter now hanging in doubt and not decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that will breed ſlander to the Calling, and danger to themſelves; ſo he orders the Preſident and others to attend him the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> about the Controverſie. Dated at <hi>Loſely</hi> the ſame day and Year with the former.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have not found among theſe Papers what was the Iſſue of this great Controverſie, but from what doth appear, make theſe following remarks.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="8" type="subsection">
                     <head>§. 8. The firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from theſe ſhort Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</head>
                     <p>Upon the whole matter we may obſerve, Firſt, That theſe ſtrict and Indiſpenſable Statutes in former times as well as now, and in all times to come, have and will Create great troubles in this College, unleſs there be in the Sovereign a Viſitatorial as well as Diſpenſing Power to Terminate endleſs Quarrels, when, as in this Caſe, both Parties ſhall inſiſt upon Grammatical and Literal ſenſe of the Statutes, and tho' the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſtr</hi> hath a power of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, yet he is ſo tyed up to the Literal and Grammatical ſenſe, that he muſt unavoidably be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66217:139"/>put ſome times to great ſtreights to determin mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>☞ Secondly, However Rigidly the Statutes ſeem to be worded, yet none can Judge, that the Kings Diſpenſing Power can be reſtrained, ſince neither the Founder could ſo bind either his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign or the Pope, nor could any of thoſe bind their Succeſſors by any Charter or Grant from ſuch inhaer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prerogatives annexed to their very Offices; as I ſhall make clear when I come to conſider the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments uſed concerning the force of theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
                     <p>☞ Therefore Thirdly, I rather Judge, that the Founder (as Entaylers of Eſtates upon their Poſterity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>nodoſam Aeternitatem</hi> often do) had a great deſire that his Statutes ſhould be perpetually obſerved, but he could not be ſuppoſed to have ſuch an over ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinion of his own prudence, but that ſome Caſes might happen whereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi> might Judge it convenient to alter them; ſo that I Reaſonably think the utmoſt of his deſign and hopes might be, that the Society it ſelf ſhould not have the power of altering them; but to Exclude the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, by their Prerogative or Acts of Parliament to Suſpend, alter, or Abrogate them, was as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his power to enjoyn, as it was vanity in him to preſume would thereby be effected.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the Secretaries Letter we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that he threatens the Queens Authority, if the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> their Viſitor, would not do the Fellows Juſtice, and in the Biſhops Letter to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident he Suſpends all thoſe on both parties, from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Voices in the next Election, which muſt be a force upon the Statutes for Election, if the Biſhop
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66217:140"/>could not Interpret their Statutes but in the Literal and Grammatical ſenſe; for it is very probable it might be known by a Literal and Grammatical ſenſe whether they were Fellows or not, and if they were Fellows the Preſident was as much bound by Oath to Admit their Voices as they obliged to give them, and if the perſons excepted againſt were no Fellows, then the Five were unlawfully Expelled, and ſo ought to have had Voices, ſo that whether way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the matter were determined, I cannot conceive the Statutes or Interpretation was Literally and Grammatically obſerved, which is the great plea of the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Fellows.</p>

                     <p>When the ſame Arch-Biſhop Viſited the Univerſities by his Metropolitical Right, he was oppoſed in it, and the matter came to be heard before the King and Council, of which I ſhall preſently give an account,

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Ancienteſt Copy of Statutes is, that which is Confirmed by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> with a Reſervation of ſuch Privileges as belonged to the Dioeceſan, and is Confirmed by the Arch-Biſhop as Provincial, without any Reſervation at all; which in reaſon he would not have done if he had been Viſitor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſent Monition to the College, Intimating a purpoſe to Viſit. From whom the Fellows Appealed to <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>By this it appears what the Opinion of the Society was then, that the King was Supreme Viſitor, and that the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> reſerved his Dioeceſan Right, yet when he deſigned an extraordinary Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Fellows Appealed to the Apoſtolic See as Supreme, and I have cleared that what power that See had, is now in the King, according to the Laws.</p>

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Firſt and before all things by Legal proof, and the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of both Parties, It appeared that the King in Right of his Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath had and hath the power of Viſiting the ſaid Univerſities as often and whenſoever it ſhould ſeem fit to the King and his Succeſſors. And that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by the Right of his Metropolitical Church hath had and hath power of Viſiting all his Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> in which the ſaid Univerſities are Scituate.</p>
                     <p>Then follows that on the part of the Univerſities, it was propoſed that by certain Charters of the King and his Prdeceſſors and Papal Bulls, they were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt and freed from all Viſitation and Juriſdiction of the ſaid Arch-Biſhop, and that Immunity by uſe of time they now enjoyed by preſcription, and on the Arch-Biſhops part it was ſhewn, that King <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>

                     <p>By this Record under the Broad Seal it is apparent, firſt, that there was a Controverſie only betwixt the Arch-Biſhop and the Univerſities, whether the Arch-Biſhop as their Metropolitan might Viſit, or they were Exempted from it. Secondly, That it was yeilded on all ſides, that the Kings Viſitation was in no manner hereby diſputed, but it is poſitively aſſerted, that the King and his Succeſſors might Viſit as often as they thought fit.

The perſon is of the long Robe, and eminent in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, who tho' he deſires not to have his Name made uſe of, yet hath been pleaſed to give me his Judgment in Writing as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Body Natural is Created by God. Bodies Politic are Created by the King, and as they are Created and receive their Being, Life, and Strength from the King; ſo they are Governed by him, and by him are corrected and puniſhed for their Irregularities or miſ-behaviors, either by ſeizure of their Liberties for a time: Or upon leſs occaſions than commonly are imagined for their Omiſſions or Commiſſions, they may be Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and diſolved at his Majeſties Suit in a <hi>Quo
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66217:146"/>Warranto;</hi> as lately was done in the Caſe of the City of <hi>London,</hi> which was not only the greateſt, and perhaps the Ancienteſt Corporation in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but was fortified alſo by many Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Ancient preſcription and cuſtom, and yet not all ſufficient to defend them againſt the King, tho' the Offences for which they were diſſolved, were not of the greateſt Magnitude.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There is no Corporation whatſoever, Lay or Spiritual, ſaith the ſame Judiciòus perſon, but is lyable to a <hi>Quo Warranto.</hi> Therefore the King was merciful to <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, that he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them by that Method.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>There are no Corporations, which are the Kings Creatures, but have ſinned againſt him to their own deſtruction, if they ſhould narrowly be looked into; as there are no Men but have ſinned againſt God: and if the King had not power, upon juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to diſſolve them, every Corporation would be in the nature of an Independent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The King is Supreme Ordinary, Viſitor, Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Regulator of all Charities; Therefore every day in Chancery he doth by his Chancellor in the Name of his Atturny General Regulate, Correct, and ſettle Charities, and when any perſon, of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Intention, is miſtaken in the end, or object of his Charity, the miſtake in Chancery is frequently corrected, and that which the Donor intended one way is there applyed or diſpoſed another way, and to another perſon, of which there are frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not doubting but all this is according to Law; how can it be thought, that the King hath not the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66217:146"/>ſame power over Univerſities and Colleges, only in other Corporations the Tryal is before the Judges of the Kings Bench, who are his Miniſterial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and in Univerſities and Colleges it is done by the Kings Mandate, or his Commiſſioners, which are but various methods of exerting the Kings power? and I think the Judgment of another great Lawyer, will be granted, that where Statutes are made upon branches of the Kings Prerogative, they are remedial and take not away the Kings concurrent power, as may be ſeen in <hi>Colt</hi> and <hi>Glovers</hi> Caſe in my Lord <hi>Hoberts</hi> Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 146.</p>

                     <p>The Foundation of this Act is grounded upon an Hypotheſis,<note place="margin">The Statute 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21. is founded upon the uſage of a diſpenſing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> that a diſpenſing power is needful in Government, and altho' it be the conſtant Opinion and Judgment of the Courts of Law, and all Lawyers, that the principal intendment of that Act was to Aboliſh the Popes power and Authority in <hi>England,</hi> in granting Licences, Diſpenſations, Faculties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet from this Act many particulars may be obſerved,<note place="margin">I muſt refer the Reader to the Act it ſelf.</note> which will ſhew, not only the allowed uſage of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing power by the Popes and Prelates in matters of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance by ſufferance, as the Act Styles it of our Kings, but that the Original Right of ſuch diſpenſations was in the King and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:66217:150"/>
                     <p>It is then Firſt to be noted from the Act,<note place="margin">The Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing power.</note> 
                        <q>that the Pope claimed by Uſurpation, as it is there Styled, and perſuaded the Subjects that he had a power to diſpenſe with all Human Laws, yea, and Cuſtoms of all Realms in all Cauſes which he called Spiritual.</q> But the ſame Act ſaith, <q>that ſuch claim of the Pope was in Derogation of the Kings Imperial Crown and Authority Royal, contrary to Right and Reaſon.<note place="margin">The power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſed by the ſufferance of the King and in derogation of the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> Therefore in the cloſe of this Section it is added — that becauſe it is now in theſe days preſent ſeen, that the State, Dignity, Superiority, Reputation, and Authority of the ſaid Imperial Crown of this Realm, by the long ſufferance of the ſaid unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and un-charitable uſurpations and exactions, practiſed in the times of the Kings moſt Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors is much and ſore decayed, and diminiſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From hence I think with ſubmiſſion,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> it muſt be owned, that if the Pope uſurped this power, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Authority Royal, then that power muſt be owned to be originally in the King, otherwiſe in the Conſtruction of the Act it could be no Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>

                     <p>☞ Beſides, it's the general Opinion of the greateſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of <hi>England,</hi> that according to the Conſtitution of our Laws, all Eccleſiaſtical power and Authority in <hi>England</hi> is Originally in the King, &amp; ſo derived from him, or if otherwiſe it is adjudged Uſurpation, and encroachment.

Yea, ſo Sacred are the Prerogatives of the Crown, that

                     <p>So my Lord <hi>Hobert</hi> upon this very Statute ſaith, that he holds it clear, that tho' this Statute ſays, that all Diſpenſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be granted in manner, and form following, <q>and <hi>not otherwiſe,</hi> yet the King is not thereby reſtrained,<note place="margin">The Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative not reſtrained by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſeveral Caſes.</note> but his power remains full and perfect as before, and he may ſtill <hi>grant them as King; for all Acts of Juſtice, and Grace, flow from him,</hi> as 4 <hi>Eliz.

                     <p>But I ſhall conclude this matter with the following Obſervations upon this Statute, which I take to be clear and undeniable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Pope did here, by his Bulls and Breves grant Diſpenſations in various Caſes, Erected,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66217:153"/>Conſtituted and Viſited Colleges, and Abrogated their Statutes, as I have cleared in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by this Act the Popes General or Univerſal power and Authority in <hi>England</hi> in all Caſes was Totally aboliſhed and taken away from him, as to the excerciſe of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſome part only of that general power and Authority, which was excerciſed by the Pope, was by that Act Veſted, Lodged, and Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in and to the Arch-Biſhop, as the diſpenſing power for Marriages, Baſtardy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there expreſſed, which was properly to be called the Popes ordinary power; and was ſo lodged, and delegated in the Arch-Biſhop, to ſave the King from trouble in ſuch ordinary and common Caſes, but not to take away the Kings ordinary power &amp; Supremacy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Popes extraordinary power, which he exerciſed in <hi>England,</hi> is as well aboliſhed here, by this and other Acts, as his ordinary power: But ſo much of the Popes Authority and power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary or extraordinary, as was at any time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſed by him here in <hi>England,</hi> and which is not by the ſaid Statute Veſted, and Delegated in the Arch-Biſhop, is by a neceſſary Conſtruction revived and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in the King, and re-united to the Crown, by all thoſe Acts which declare the Kings<note n="*" place="margin">See.

                        </note> Supremacy; yea tho' the Statutes had been ſilent therein, for that the Crown by this and other Acts, is entirely remitted and reſtored to all it's Ancient Juriſdictions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives exerciſed by the Popes, from whence our Law Books ſay, it was Robbed or derived. Becauſe ſuch powers being taken away from the Pope, and ſuch as had Authority under him, and neither ſettled in any Court or perſon by the Statute, can re-veſt or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66217:153"/>re-ſult to none other but the King as Supreme in all Eccleſiaſtical, as well as Temporal Cauſes, which by Sufferance or Uſurpation, as the Act ſaith, the Pope had excerciſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By the ſeveral Acts and Inſtances, whereby the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince the making of this Act of the <hi>25th.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> have exerted their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, it is clear that the Crowns Re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of what the Pope had exerciſed, hath been according to the Laws in being; of which I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give Inſtances in the Kings diſpenſing with College Statutes, of which I ſhall give ſome few, in ſeveral Caſes, of many hundreds which are to be found in the Paper Office, or Secretaries Books.</p>

And the ſame moſt Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Biſhop is ſo far from allowing ſuch ſubjects, at leaſt Fellows of Colleges, to reſiſt the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of their Sovereign, under pretence that they have Sworn to the contrary, that he ſaith expreſly, that the ſubject ought not in thoſe things in which he is ſubject to another, Swear to do any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at leaſt preſuming his Superiors conſent, his words are, <hi>Non debet Subditus in iis rebus in quibus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri ſubeſt Jurare ſe facturum quicquam abſque prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpto ſaltem Superioris ſui Conſenſu.</hi>

                     <p>Hence in the Inſtance Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> brings of the Sons obligation to obey his Fathers Command, tho' it hinder him from performing his own Oath, he obſerves that the Son Swore to act with the Tacit conſent of his Father, which he had reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the thing being lawful in it ſelf, and yet the Oath is reſcinded, which directly Anſwers the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                     <p>☞ It is further urged,<note place="margin">Second Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that the Fellows bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Oath, neither to ſeek to obtain any Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with any of their Statutes, nor yet Admit of any directly or indirectly obtained, which is the higheſt of Tyes that an Oath can bind to, without a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:66217:167"/>Imprecation, which is annexed in ſome Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
                     <p>To this I Anſwer, that ſuch Oaths are ill impoſed by Founders, not ſo much becauſe the obligation is in it ſelf not to be diſſolved, but becauſe it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex ſome ſcrupulous Conſciences and may afford Umbrages to ſuch as are unwilling to yield to their Superiors diſpenſation to inſiſt more earneſtly and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly upon the obligation.</p>
                     <p>I rather believe ſuch Clauſes have been Inſerted by Founders to prevent as much as in them lay, the Members of the Societies to Innovate matters, than that they could foreſee, that it was more obligatory by the addition of that Clauſe. We may eaſily Judge that all Munificent Founders would contrive all the ways whereby their Gifts, and the uſes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of them might be perpetuated, as we ſee in ſeveral perſons ſettlements of their Eſtates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they endeavor to Entayl them to their Heirs paſt all poſſibility of Alienations; yet by the Laws of the Land, which are not favorable to ſuch perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities, we find dayly examples of docking the moſt Artificially contrived Entayls.</p>
                     <p>☞ Now that any Founder in the time when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic Religion was Eſtabliſhed here, could think that ſuch Clauſes could be perpetually oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I can ſee no reaſon when they could not but know, that none of their Statutes or Conſtitutions had any force, but as they were confirmed by their Sovereigns whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, and in all ſuch Caſes, tho' the preſent Sovereigns, whether the King of <hi>England</hi> or the Pope did ratifie them, yet this could bind neither of their Succeſſors.</p>

                     <p>☞ For as to the King it is a Rule in Common-Law, that general words of an Act of Parliament where the King is not named cannot bind him, as may be ſeen in the Authorities Cited in the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cro. 3d. part.

                     <p>☞ If therefore the Common-Law, which ſeems in many particulars leſs to favor the Prerogative, be ſo juſt to the King, that he is Exempted from the force of an Act of Parliament in which he is not named, ſurely he muſt be exempted from a College Statute in which he is not named, Secondly, If the King had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by Name the exception had been Null, for the Founder neither if Living would have Exempted the Society from the Kings Paramount Juriſdiction, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, being a ſubject, if he would have done it as<note n="(b)" place="margin">Cujus <hi>i. e.</hi> Regis Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictioni ſoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litium Illud neque voluiſſe fundatorem, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que (ſubditus cum fuerit) ſi vellet potuiſſe omnino conſtare. <hi>Wood</hi> Antiq. <hi>Oxon</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi> fol. <hi>403.</hi>

                     <p>☞ Thirdly, If it be further urged, that the Founders Founded the Colleges and Endowed them on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the King would allow the Society to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their Statutes, which is but an unproved preſumption, as not appearing in any Charter I have met with, yet if ſuch conditions were to be found, the Succeeding Kings at leaſt are not obliged in point of ſtrict Juſtice to obſerve ſuch Orders or Decrees of their Predeceſſors, becauſe <hi>Par in Parem non habet poteſtatem aut Imperium,</hi> and in ſuch matters the Graces and Favors of Preceeding Kings are alterable and ſuſpendible at the pleaſure of the Succeeding So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, who cannot be Impaired in any Act of his Sovereignty by his Predeceſſor; ſo that to think that a King of <hi>England</hi> can by any of his Subjects Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions be bound from Viſiting or giving his own Interpretation of the Statutes is a great weakneſs; of which I ſhall Treat more fully in it's proper place,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66217:168"/>and only Infer at preſent, that the obligation of any Subjects Oath neither to take nor Admit of any Diſpenſation, is in it ſelf of no force to obſtruct the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign from diſpenſing, and when he doth diſpenſe no Oath is obligatory to any that hath Sworn to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch Statutes as are not in being while he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth with them.</p>
                     <p>☞ Thus much I thought fit to offer as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Secular power. As to the Popes Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it was very Incongruous and weak for any Founder to expect that the Members of the Society could oppoſe the Popes diſpenſation with any Statute which his Holineſs for the time being ſhould think fit to alter or Abrogate; for as<note n="(a)" place="margin">Validum eſſe voſum aut Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramentum non petendi diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationem aut relaxationem voti quamdiu animae volentis utilius eſt non petere diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem — Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior tamen poteſt non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante tali voto diſoenſare, &amp; diſpenſatio va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida eſt, nam vetum ſubditi non aufert Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periori poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem diſpenſandi. — Jurantes vel volentes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſub paena, ut ſi fecerint non poſſunt ab alio abſolvi vel diſpenſari quam à ſummo Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, poſſunt adhuc abſolvi ab Epiſcopo — nam hujuſmodi votum vel Juramentum non aufert Epiſcopis Juriſdictionem — Ita communiter D.

                     <p>A Second Objection I have met with is, that the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> being the Local Viſitor appointed by the Statutes of Biſhop <hi>Waynflet,</hi> it ſeemed more agreeable to a formal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he ſhould have exerciſed his power of Viſitation before the King had ordered Dr. <hi>Hough, &amp;c.</hi> to have been proceeded againſt by the Lords Commiſſioners for Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt in the Reſolution of a very Eminent Lawyer, that the Local Viſitor is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and truſted by the Founder, and thereby hath a private Truſt. But the King as King hath a public Truſt by operation and conſtruction of Law, and by his Sovereign Authority and Juriſdiction is Supreme Viſitor, and may exerciſe that Royal Truſt (as thoſe of the long Robe uſe to expreſs his Prerogative ſometimes) when and as often as he pleaſeth, without any Commanding or expecting the Viſitation of the Local Viſitor; and having the general care of, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66217:169"/>Inſpection into the Manners and Duties of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may not only Viſit, Enquire into, and Reform the Members of the College as to their Actions, but alſo Viſit the Local Viſitor himſelf as to his doing and performances in or about his Truſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is certain the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as I have by many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents cleared before, have Viſited, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Local Viſitors being appointed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more may the King who is Supreme Viſitor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the ſpeedy Application of Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> before I preſume his Lordſhip could have notice of the Kings Inhibition, he had Admitted him, ſo that he was ſo far become a party concerned, that it was no ways convenient for him to have proceeded in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Local Viſitor is appointed only for the eaſe of the Crown in ordinary Caſes. But it cannot be ſuppoſed that if a Local Viſitor ſhould neglect to do his Office, or ſhould be partial, there ſhould not be a power in the Sovereign to order the Viſitor, ſeeing it would be a great deficiency in the Oeconomy of Government, that a power ſhould not be lodged ſome where to compel a Local Viſitor to do his duty if he failed in it, which can ultimately remain in none but the King.</p>

                     <p>In the third place in the particular concerns of Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> it is urged,<note place="margin"> See here <hi>p.</hi> 67.</note> that the Sentence againſt him could not be good in Law, ſince he was not Cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Commiſſioners at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in perſon or by Proxy before them, nor had his cauſe brought before them when Sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion was given againſt him, which thoſe that are
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:66217:170"/>his favorers Cenſure as very hard uſage that one ſhould be condemned unheard.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to which it muſt be conſidered, that the King by his Mandate having ſet aſide and ſuſpended the College Statutes for Electing a perſon Qualified within thoſe Statutes and impowering the College by his Royal Command without breach of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Rule, and their Oath upon it to Elect a perſon not capable of being Elected by their College Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as hath been abundantly cleared in the laſt Section, Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> was not to be conſidered as due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Elected, and ſo <hi>revera</hi> was no Preſident, therefore could not be taken cognizance of as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>But as Fellow he was Cited, and did make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and was heard as the reſt of the Fellows were, and under other Circumſtances he was not Legally to be taken notice of.

                     <head>§. 3. The fourth Objection.</head>
                     <p>It is Fourthly objected,<note place="margin"> See here <hi>p.</hi> 67.</note> That Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected out of a Free hold for Life without any Writ of Ejectment or Tryal at Common-Law, contrary to the freedom of a Subject.</p>
                     <p>To this I Anſwer, That there are two ſorts of Free-holds, <hi>viz.</hi> Abſolute and Conditional; as to the firſt it is true, that no perſon can be diſpoſſeſſed of it, but by due courſe of Law, and in caſe of reſiſtance no other way but by the Sheriff and his <hi>Poſſe Comitatus.</hi> But in a Conditional or Attendant Free-hold as this
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66217:170"/>of a College is, a Man may be diſpoſſeſſed without that Courſe if he perform not the Condition of his Free-hold, ſo <hi>Thomas Coveney</hi> ſometime Preſident of this College was deprived of his Free-hold Attendant on the Preſidentſhip, for that he was not entred into Holy Orders, and another ſubſtituted in his place without a Sheriff or <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> for not performing ſome conditions required by his Office, tho' duly Elected. Therefore much more might Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> be Ejected by the Lords Commiſſioners Sentence, who never was <hi>de Jure</hi> Preſident.</p>
                     <p>In this Caſe the Free-hold is only Attendant upon the Office, ſo that by whatever Legal proceeding, the Office is declared and adjudged void, by the ſame the Attendant Free hold ceaſeth, any more to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the perſon Ejected or Deprived. So a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath an Houſe and Glebe-Land, and by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is ſuſpended or deprived <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> immediately his Right ceaſeth, as to that Free-hold, during his ſuſpenſion or deprivation, yea it is more here, for he is as a perſon Dead.</p>
                     <p>So in any like Caſe, an Officer that hath an Houſe, Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> annexed to his Office, and holds that Office <hi>durante beneplacito Regis,</hi> this is his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold while he holds the Office, but when ever the King gives him a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> the Free-hold Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon that Office from that moment ceaſeth to be his Free-hold; now the Decree of the Lords Commiſſioners of Deprivation, Expulſion or Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is as much a final Judgment againſt Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> whoſe Cauſe was of their Cognizance, as any Verdict in a Court of Common Law for Ejectment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>☞ That this Mandate included a prohibition to chooſe any other perſon beſides him that was named in the Mandate, ſeems clear to me by the known Rule <hi>Intus exiſtens prohibet alienum.</hi>

                     <p>But in the Civil Law we find, that thoſe things<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mandato contineri ca vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur ſine quibus Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum explicari non poteſt. l.

Now I think it is impoſſible to explain the poſitive Mandate to chooſe Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> without underſtanding, that by that the choice of all other perſons was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, which is ſtill made apparent by another Law,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Mandato aliquo ea quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Mandata Intelliguntur quae ex co conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur. l.

                     <p>Upon this ſuppoſition therefore, that an Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in the Caſe, it is eaſie to conclude how great a Crime it was in the Fellows to diſ-obey, for it was no leſs than to diſpute the Kings Sovereignty, and Juriſdiction, than which there can be no Crime greater but open Rebellion, for there is but that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt one that draws the Sword to reſiſt the Kings Authority, and one that by Vote and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy doth it, but that one is Armed and the other un-armed, for the denying the Authority is alike in both.</p>

                     <p>The Civilians do further diſtinguiſh betwixt an Expreſs and a Tacit Inhibition, as when a Prince doth avocate the Cauſe from any Court; for when a Prince doth this of his certain knowledge, he lays an Inhibition on the Judges and parties. So in this Caſe of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, the King took away from the Fellows the liberty of chooſing ſuch a perſon as their Statutes obliged them to chooſe, by the diſpenſing with the Statutes; therefore in that he ſeems plainly to Inhibit their Electing of any according to the Letter of the Statutes as before I have cleared in the Anſwer to the Objection, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>§.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 295. here to which I refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Dilemma of Dr. <hi>Stafford</hi> ſeems to have no ſuch contradiction in <hi>Terminis,</hi>

                     <p>It is neceſſary for every Court to Aſſert it's Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and much more ought the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to do it, being they have ſuch Ample powers from the King, ſo that whatever Contempt was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to their Lordſhips, was to the King himſelf, and that Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> perſiſted to the laſt in denying the Authority of the Lords Commiſſioners, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the Kings Mandate for Admitting the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> Preſident, or ſubmitting to him as ſuch, appears by his laſt Anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed <hi>October</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> whether he owned their Lordſhips Juriſdiction?

                     <head>§. 16. The Ninth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that matter of Fact proves not right.</head>
                     <p>It is Ninthly Objected, that tho' it be allowed that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ſometimes diſpenſed with College Statutes, and done thoſe things I have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Inſtanced in; yet that proves not the Right or Juſtice of the thing; ſince <hi>à facto ad jus, non valet conſequentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I Anſwer,<note place="margin">The Anſwer.</note> there is a vaſt diſ-proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Acts of Kings, and of Subjects. Conſtant and un-interrupted uſage are the Foundations of the Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> which are Incorporated into the Common Law of the Land, and ſo many Rights are determined for private perſons. But in the Orders of the Sovereign, one declaration of his pleaſure by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, in ſeveral Caſes is ſufficient Precedent, tho' but rarely made uſe of, upon the preſumption in Law, that ſuch Acts of Kings are not without deliberate conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. However the conſtant practice of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> which I hope I have fully proved, takes away all colour for this Argument: And it is moſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66217:183"/>certain, if the Kings diſpenſing power with Statutes, and putting in Heads of Colleges, Fellows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Mandates,<note place="margin">If the Kings Prerogative in this Caſe had been againſt Law, it would have been queſtioned at ſome time.</note> had been againſt the Law, we ſhould at ſome time or other heard of Actions brought before the Judges, againſt the Kings Authority in that matter, and found determinations upon them in favor of the aggrieved, which I think is not to be found. But the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been in Poſſeſſion of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in all Ages,<note place="margin">The King in Poſſeſſion of this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> tho' moſt conſpicuouſly ſince the Reformation, and ſo this Prerogative muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to appertain to the King, till by ſome Legal Tryal it ſhall be determined otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>It may be upon this Topick rationally urged, that tho' the Kings diſpenſing power in other matters be in the Law Books only made out in ſome particular Caſes; yet thoſe ſufficiently prove that the Original Prerogative of Diſpenſation being in the King;<note place="margin">The Original Prerogative of diſpenſing in the King.</note> it may branch it ſelf to all ſuch matters as the King pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to apply it to, which by no particular Act he or his Predeceſſors, as far as they can oblige him, have debarred themſelves from the exerciſe of, and the continual Series of this diſpenſing ſometime in one &amp; other times in a freſh matter, is ſufficient evidence that our Kings have not given up this Prerogative wholly.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone through the moſt material Objections I have met with in the Vindication of the diſ-obedience of the Fellows. As to the puniſhments inflicted upon them for it, I ſuppoſe none will queſtion but they are according to Rules of Law, upon ſuppoſal the Crimes were clearly proved.</p>

               <p>By this Record it is manifeſt, that the King by Mandate could reſtore a Graduate who had been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Univerſity, and by parity of reaſon he muſt have the ſame Right to place any in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity according to his Royal pleaſure; and whereas by this Expulſion there was a Suſpenſion of his Degree, the King Capacitates him to receive it, when the time required by the Statutes of the Univerſity was expired, altho' he was thus diſ-enabled.</p>
               <p>So that in this one precept four particulars of the Kings Prerogative over the Univerſity are Aſſerted expreſly,<note place="margin">The preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the King over the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, cleared in four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by this Mandate.</note> which in the foregoing parts of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I have by other Inſtances cleared, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt that the King is Supreme Viſitor, to alter at his pleaſure the Sentences, Decrees, or determinations of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. Secondly, that tho' the Univerſity by their Statutes might ſtop a Graduate from taking an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degree, yet the King at his pleaſure might reſtore him to his Priſtin State, and make him capable of receiving his Degrees at the time limited by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Thirdly, that the King did this without any formal proceedings at Law, but by his own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority and pleaſure only declared in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. Fourthly, that if the Chancellor did refuſe to obey the Mandate, the King threatens to have his pleaſure fulfilled by his Royal power.</p>

               <p>From this Interpretation of the Local Viſitor,<note place="margin">Obſervations upon this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Local Viſitor.</note> it may firſt be obſerved, that the Viſitors appointed by the Queen did publiſh Injunctions about Elections by the powers given them from the Queen; yet after the Queen did her ſelf impoſe upon the College new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Statutes. Secondly, that the Biſhop judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the later Statutes made void the former, and ſo adheres to the obſervation of the laſt.

               <p>Sub obteſtatione Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Judicii ſpecialiter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungimus munimus &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuper Statuimus ut Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pella noſtri Collegii &amp; Aula, ſingulaque alia Aedificia Dei adjutorio laborioſe noſtris <hi>ſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aedificata</hi> in muris Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operturis, &amp; qualibet ſui parte perpetuis futuris Temporibus per Dei gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam debite ſufficienter &amp; congrue in omnibus ſuſtententur.</p>
               <p>Under the humble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching of Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſpecially enjoyn Strengthen and likewiſe Conſtitute that the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our College, and the Hall and all other the Buildings which by the help of God at our coſts with great labor have been Erected, may by Gods Grace in all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times be duely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and conveniently kept in repair in the Walls, Rooffs and every part in all things.</p>
               <p>How this Statute hath been obſerved, appears by the late pulling down and Selling the Materials of the College of <hi>Brakley</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> which by the Founder was built as a place for the Members of the College to Inhabit in and purſue their Studies, in caſe Fire or Plague, or any other public Calamity might enforce the Scholars and Fellows to remove from the College at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

               <p>Upon the Ejected Fellows grand plea of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Literal and Grammatical Senſe of the Statute
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66217:189"/>and admitting no diſpenſation by any Authority ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſee not how the Fellows can avoid being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſay the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt before they go to Election, as the Statute expreſly enjoyns, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſay dayly Maſſes, Solemn Obits, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prayers for the Souls of the Founders and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if they allege that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to uſe ſuch by Act of Parliament, they confeſs that their Statutes are diſpenſed with by ſome Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that they yield to and allow ſuch diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is againſt the Literal ſence of the Oath, which I have recited before:<note place="margin">Vide pag. <hi>33. here.</hi>
                  </note> And I hope I have made it clear, that the King hath as much Authority to Suſpend, and ſo Temporarily aboliſh any of their Statutes, as an Act of Parliament hath to perpetuate it.</p>
               <p>☞ I need not touch upon the Qualifications required in the perſons to be Elected,<note place="margin">Concerning purchaſing of Fellowſhips.</note> as that they ſhould be poor, when it is notoriouſly known, that not only in the times long ſince Fellowſhips have been bought, but Mony payed for Reſignations, and if I be not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed, even ſome of the late Ejected Fellows had not re-inburſed themſelves of the Mony they had payed to purchaſe their Fellowſhips, ſo that it was grown to a by-word, that an Election at St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> was a <hi>Magdalen</hi> Fair.</p>
               <p>Having thus touched upon ſome of the Statutes, which we find the Society have taken upon them to diſpenſe with or aboliſh,<note place="margin">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66217:190"/>their public Regiſter, I am enabled to clear the Caſe moſt fully.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not repeat what I have obſerved before out of Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> Antiquities of <hi>Oxford,</hi> but only note how faithful he hath been in his Collections, and that this Dr. <hi>Haddon</hi> was every way as uncapable of being Elected Preſident by the Literal and Grammatical ſence of the Statute, as Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> was.</p>

               <p>For the better undeſtanding this Petition, it muſt be obſerved, that Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> Founded <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge</hi> for Students in Divinity, that it might be a Nurſery for Divines; and gave ſeveral Benefices with Cure of Souls, to be beſtowed upon the Fellows, as they fell void, that they might be Preachers in the Country. That therefore they might not be ſuperannuated in the College, he made one of the Statutes <hi>de Mora Sociorum,</hi> that the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſhould leave the College ſome ſhort ſpace of time after they were Doctors of Divinity, and they were to take the preceding Degrees, according to the ſtrictneſs of the Statutes of the Univerſity, for the taking Degrees when of due ſtanding. By ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statute <hi>de Reſidentia Sociorum,</hi> they were tyed to ſtrict Reſidence, ſo that they could not go abroad to have converſation and obtain the advantages that a relaxation of that ſtrict Reſidence might have
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66217:193"/>afforded them, whereby they might have made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for themſelves in obtaining Benefices, in caſe there ſhould none fall in the Interim.</p>
               <p>Now it ſo hapned, that the Founder had not annexed a ſufficient number of Spiritual Benefices, ſo that ſome of them when Doctors of Divinity muſt have left the College un-provided for.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations induced ſome of the Fellows to Petition for a diſpenſation with this Statute; and upon the ſuggeſtions in that Petition, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt granted it.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems this diſpenſation was not ſo well liked by others, and even ſome of the firſt Petitioners joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and exhibited this following Petition.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The main ground the former Petitioners went upon,<note place="margin">Nine Reaſons for this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was a perſuaſion that either this was no Statute, or not of like validity with the reſt, which upon full proof, (after long debating) being by the Heads of Colleges Confeſſed to be otherwiſe, they did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe their ſuit, and ſome of them became Petitioners that the ſaid Statute might be re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Maſter by his Oath which he took at his Admiſſion, is bound both to keep all the Statutes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably himſelf, as alſo to ſee the ſame done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which the Suſpenſion forbiddeth him in this Statute <hi>de Morâ Sociorum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fellows by their Oath at their Admiſſion are debarred from accepting any diſpenſation, either againſt any of the Founders Statutes, or againſt that their Oath: and thereby ſeem to be diſabled from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any benefit of this Suſpenſion expreſly containing a diſpenſation with the ſaid Oath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. None of the Fellows to our knowledge, was ever yet by vertue of the ſaid Statute turned out of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip unprovided, excepting one only of the preſent Petitioners, who notwithſtanding before he left the College was provided of a good Parſonage, from whence he was ſince choſen Maſter of the ſaid College.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Since the Suſpenſion, ſix of the Fellows, before their time granted by Statute was expired, have been called to good Benefices with Paſtoral charge, four of which were the Petitioners for the qualification of the ſaid Statute.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We conceive juſt grounds of fear, partly by what we have heard, partly for other ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that the ſaid Suſpenſion hath already been and may prove hereafter, a diſcouragement to thoſe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:66217:194"/>who otherwiſe would be Benefactors to our College.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Fellowſhips being but few in this College, if they be enlarged to perpetuity, younger Scholars will be diſ-couraged in their Studies, ſeeing ſmall hope of preferment for them, &amp; be forced to leave the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity before they be well fitted for a Paſtoral charge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whereas our Honorable Founder Erected this College for a Nurſery to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and expreſſeth this to have been his meaning, that thoſe who were brought up in it, ſhould upon a fair Call, be tranſplanted hence, after they were fitted for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the aforeſaid liberty of longer continuance, will in likelihood, make ſome unwilling, to take on them a Paſtoral charge being offered, whereby the Founders Pious intent ſhall be croſſed, the Church deprived of the labors of ſuch, and they ſhall not only remain unprofitable in the College, but alſo may in ſhort time draw to themſelves the Chief Government of the ſame, the Maſter having no Negative voice to hinder it, as all other Maſters of Colleges have.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Statute ſtanding in it's former force, would have prevented no ſmall diſturbances of the peace of the College which have lately hapened.</p>

               <head>§. 14. Obſervations upon this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
               <p>Upon this Petition King <hi>Charles the</hi> Firſt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, referred the matter to the Vice-Chancellor and ſome Heads of Colleges, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, upon whoſe report the King ſaw no reaſon to take off his diſpenſation; altho' the Grandſon of the Founder promiſed to add more Spiritual Benefices
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:66217:194"/>to the Revenue of the College, whereby the Fellows might be better provided for.</p>
               <p>Here firſt we may note, that one part of the Oath which the Fellows take being in theſe words, — <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam diſpenſationem contra Statuta fundatoris impetrabo, nec impetrari curabo, nec Impetratam acceptabo, viz.</hi> that they will neither obtain any diſpenſation contrary to the Statutes of the Founder, nor will endeavor that any other ſhould obtain them, or will accept of any ſuch being obtained, ſo that the Fellows of this College were under the like obligation as theſe of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College were.</p>
               <p>Yet Secondly they all own the Kings power in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with this Statute, and only by way of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhew their Reaſons why the King ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to revoke it, but we hear of no perſiſting in the matter ſo as to cauſe the King to exerciſe his Supreme Authority to enforce their obedience; but pay a ready obedience, and that diſpenſation is in force to this day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is to be noted, that this diſpenſation was granted and yielded to, in a time when there were no public animoſities, or that any Factious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in the State Caballed againſt the Crown; but all was Calm, it being in the Halcyon Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the Prerogative of the Crown was not diſputed. Therefore we ought to allow this as a moſt Authentic Precedent of the Kings diſpenſing power, not for one or more ſingle perſons, but with an entire Statute which concerned the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſeveral perſons in that, and in ſucceeding Ages.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As to the perſons that Petition, Dr. <hi>Sandcroft</hi> was then Maſter, and Unkle to the preſent Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tuckney</hi> was in the time of the long Parliaments Uſurpation Maſter of St. <hi>Johns</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> Maſter of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:66217:195"/>
                  <hi>Trinity</hi> College, Dr. <hi>Bridge</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> were great Preachers, and Daemagogs of that Parliament.</p>

               <head>§. 15. Dr. <hi>Brady's</hi> Account of the Kings Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of <hi>Kings</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I ſhall now cloſe this with an Account which the Learned Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> Regius Phyſic Profeſſor in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> hath given me at my deſire when he was at the laſt Commencement — <q>That in Kings College in <hi>Cambridge</hi> they have a Statute that directs them to chooſe a Provoſt in ſuch Form, and with ſuch Qualifications as are appointed in the Statute, and by Oath are bound not to accept of any Diſpenſation to the contrary, yet from the very Foundation by King <hi>H.</hi> 6. the Provoſt was ever named by the King to be choſen by the Fellows, and it hath been ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved. The Fellows, as the preſent Provoſt informs, put up a Petition to King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, that he would be Graciouſly pleaſed to leave them to their free choice: But his Anſwer was, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was Abrogated by the very practice of the Founder, who Named two Provoſts Succeſſively in his Life time, and by the conſtant practice of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings, and that he was their Founder, for that the King never Dyes, and he would not part with his Right of Nomination, but in other things would leave them to the free uſe of their Statutes.</q> Thus far the Doctors Letter.</p>
               <p>I might add many other Modern Inſtances of the entire obedience payed to the Kings Mandates by Maſters and Fellows of Colleges, and the unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Kings diſpenſing with Statutes in both Univerſities, and particularly in St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> College, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, but underſtanding that a Member of that College hath Writ a Tract on that Subject, I ſhall here Conclude.</p>
